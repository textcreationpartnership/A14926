            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>Now I reaÅ¿on thus.

Secund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, the Catholicke Kirk comprehendes them that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ChriÅ¿t: But the Kirk of Rome comprehendes not them, for there was a Kirk, or euer there was a Kirk at Rome, and the Romane Kirk comprehends nane but them that acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges the Pope to bee the head of the Kirk. But thoÅ¿e that were before ChriÅ¿t neuer did that: Therefore the Romane Kirk is not the Catholicke Kirk. Thirdlie, the Catholicke Kirk is inviÅ¿ible: for at the leaÅ¿t, neither are they that ar glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, neither are they that are to bee borne, viÅ¿ible. But ye wil not haue the Romane Kirk, but alwayes viÅ¿ible, therefore the Romane Kirk is not the Catholicke Kirk. Fourthlie, if the Romane Kirk be the Catholicke Kirk, then either it Å¿hall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the Pope is the heade of the Catholicke Kirk, or elÅ¿e that the Romane Kirk wants a viÅ¿ible heade. ChooÅ¿e you whether of theÅ¿e ye will, for the ane ye muÅ¿t, if ye will haue the Romane Kirk to be the Catholicke Kirk. But to Å¿ay that the Pope is the head of the Catholicke Kirk, I trowe ye dare not be Å¿o blaÅ¿phemous: for the gloryfied Saints, &amp; <hi>Peter</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elfe are of the Catholicke Kirk, or elÅ¿e (as I Å¿aid before) Pope <hi>Pius</hi> and the fathers of <hi>Trent</hi> erres. And Å¿o then if ye will make him heade of the Catholicke Kirk, ye muÅ¿te make him heade
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:20312:23"/> of the gloryfied Saints and of <hi>Peter</hi> alÅ¿o. So then chooÅ¿e you whether will ye leaue the Å¿tyle of Catholicke, whilk ye claime as proper to your Kirk, or will ye haue the Pope the heade of the triumphant Kirk in heauen: or laÅ¿t of all, will yee haue your Romane Kirk to want a viÅ¿ible heade: ane of theÅ¿e ye muÅ¿t chooÅ¿e. So to ende this poynte, this Å¿tyle of Catholicke it is like the numbering of the people by <hi>Dauid:</hi> for as it brought him in a wonderfull Å¿traite,
<note place="margin">2. Sam. 14.</note> when he Å¿awe it behoued him to chooÅ¿e, either Å¿eauen yeares famine, or foure moneths flying before his enemies, or three daies peÅ¿tile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce. So this title of yours if you will bide by it, brings you in a wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>derful Å¿trait: for yee haue not the choiÅ¿e of ane of three euils, but theÅ¿e three things muÅ¿t ye either chooÅ¿e, or elÅ¿e let this Å¿tyle of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke goe; ane of you fighting againÅ¿t ane vther, the Kirk inviÅ¿ible, and the Pope not to bee the heade of the Kirk. Of the whilk, the leaÅ¿t of theÅ¿e is more able to overthrow your Kingdome, then they all were able to haue ouerthrowne the Kingdome of Dauid, for they are the maine pillers of your Kingdome, your vnitie, your viÅ¿ibilitie, your Popes Å¿uprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, all whilk you muÅ¿t either loÅ¿e, or elÅ¿e let your Å¿tyle of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke goe from your Kirk. But howe will ye wreÅ¿tle your Å¿elfe out of this? For if ye will beleeue the fathers of <hi>Trent,</hi> and Pope <hi>Pius,</hi> in defyning the Catholick Kirk, ye cannot eÅ¿chew thir inconveniences.

And is onlie Catholick, becauÅ¿e of the Catholicke doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine that Å¿he profeÅ¿Å¿es? But if this be true, wherefore then did your generall councill condemne it in <hi>Iohn Hus,</hi> and burne him for that doctrine, whilk both your Å¿elf muÅ¿te confeÅ¿Å¿e to bee true, and is aggreable to Scripture, fathers, and your owne Popes. Next I Å¿ay, Å¿uppoÅ¿e when ye are brought to this Å¿trait, ye muÅ¿te Å¿ay Å¿o: yet for al this, not onlie call ye your Kirk Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke, becauÅ¿e of the Å¿oundnes of doctrine whilk yee Å¿up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e Å¿he profeÅ¿Å¿es, but
<note n="(e)" place="margin">As appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by the epiÅ¿t. of Cardinal Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿anus writing to the Bohemians. Cochlaeus hiÅ¿tor HuÅ¿sitar. lib. 12</note> alÅ¿o &amp; Å¿peciallie to make the Å¿imple beleeue, that there is no Å¿aluation out of her. Therefore ye call it the onlie true Kirk, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Catholicke Kirk: for out of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Kirk there is Saluation, but out of the Catholicke Kirk there is no Å¿aluation. Thirdlie I Å¿aye, as the epiÅ¿tles of <hi>Peter, Iohn, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> are intituled <hi>Catholick,</hi> not becauÅ¿e of the Å¿oundneÅ¿Å¿e of their doctrine, whilk is common to the epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tles of <hi>Paul</hi> alÅ¿o, and al the reÅ¿t of the Scripture, whilk in that reÅ¿pect may alÅ¿o be called Catholicke, but becauÅ¿e they are written generallie to all: So the Kirk is called Catholick pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, not becauÅ¿e of the Å¿oundnes of doctrine, for that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all the particular Kirks, that hes the puritie of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but becauÅ¿e it comprehends all the particular Kirks and all the elect. And alÅ¿o to put a difference betweene the Kirk of the Iewes, whilk did comprehend but ane certaine peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, &amp; the ChriÅ¿tian Kirk Å¿ince the comming of ChriÅ¿t, whilk is not bound to any certaine place or nation, or people, but indifferently receaues al, both Iew and gentile that beleeues. &amp; therfore is it called Catholick: &amp; therfore in our beleef we Å¿ay not, I beleeue the Catholick doctrine, but the Catholick Kirk. So by this Å¿he is properlie diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed from particular kirks, as the Mother from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> daughters, &amp; the hail body from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> particular members. So the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> if you would Å¿peak properlie of your Kirk, &amp; not make your Å¿tyles Å¿nares, to catch y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Å¿oules of

VtherwiÅ¿e, if you will but call her the Catholicke Kirk, you firÅ¿t rob the mother, for Å¿he is properlie Catholicke, and alÅ¿o iniures the reÅ¿te of the daughters: For in reÅ¿pect of the Å¿oundnes of faith, they maye alÅ¿o challenge the Å¿ame to them. And thirdly, ye deceaue the Å¿oules of the Å¿imple thereby, by making them beleeue there is not ane vther Kirk but yours.

                     <p>Now, as to the teÅ¿timonies whilk ye quote out of the olde TeÅ¿tament, and out of the firÅ¿t of Luke, verÅ¿. 33. in the new te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tament, they onelie prooue that the Kirk and kingdome of ChriÅ¿t Å¿hall indure for euermore, and that his couenant made with her, is euerlaÅ¿ting. The whilk cannot exeeme the milita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t Kirk from erring in points of doctrine, for both the chaffe &amp; euil Å¿eed in the Kirk, that is, theÅ¿e that are called, but not cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿en, may erre, and that to death and damnation, and yet his Kirk and kingdome, and his couenaunt, remaineth Å¿ure, Å¿table, and inviolate: for the Lord onelie offers his couenant vnto them, and they through incredulitie reiect it, and Å¿o he is not bund to Å¿anctifie or Å¿aue them, meikle-leÅ¿Å¿e to keip them from error. And as for theÅ¿e who are called &amp; cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿en, all theÅ¿e promiÅ¿es are made and performed in euerie one of them, and the couenaunt of God is Å¿o Å¿ure in euerie one of them, that our Sauiour Å¿ayes, <hi>None of them can periÅ¿h.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ioh, 10.28</note> And yet for all this, euerie one of them may erre in doctrine, Å¿uppoÅ¿e not to death and damnation, whilk ye will not deny. And gif ye would, infinite examples not onlie of the Saints of God, of the laickes (as ye call them) but alÅ¿o of the PrieÅ¿ts, Prophets, ApoÅ¿tles; yea, and of Popes alÅ¿o, and of your owne Doctours and BiÅ¿hops, as a cloude of witneÅ¿Å¿es, would Å¿tand vp and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowe the Å¿ame in your face.

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:20312:28"/> his Kirk. Therefore, I Å¿ay, the promiÅ¿es of the Å¿tabilitie of ChriÅ¿ts kingdome, and the perpetuitie of his couenant made with her, cannot exeeme the militant Kirk from erring in points of doctrine: Å¿a ye haue loÅ¿t your vantguarde.

                     <p>The next place ye quote is the 16. of Matthew, ver. 18. <hi>Thou art Peter, and vpon this rocke I will builde my Kirk, and the yets of hell Å¿hall not preuaile againÅ¿t it.</hi> And becauÅ¿e ye truÅ¿t that there is not a teÅ¿timonie of Å¿cripture whilk Å¿hall feight mair for you nor this: let vs therefore try it to the vttermoÅ¿te, and Å¿ee how far it can be Å¿treatched out. What argument will ye frame out of this place? for, if you gather no more but this, ChriÅ¿t hath promiÅ¿ed that the gates of hell Å¿hall neuer preuaile againÅ¿t the Kirk that is builded on the rocke, that is, on ChriÅ¿t: Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Kirk that is builded on him, Å¿hall neuer be alluterlie exÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed and aboliÅ¿hed by Satan. Then <hi>Bellarmine</hi> telles you that ye Å¿pend but time in proouing of this, for we graunt it, That the Kirk of the choÅ¿en Å¿hall neuer periÅ¿he. But if you go farther, and Å¿ay: That the Kirk of ChriÅ¿t Å¿hall neuer erre, becauÅ¿e ChriÅ¿t hath promiÅ¿ed that the yettes of hell Å¿hall not preuaile againÅ¿t it: then, I Å¿ay, either that expoÅ¿ition is falÅ¿e, or els y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gates of hel Å¿huld haue preuailed long Å¿ince againÅ¿t your kirk: for whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> it preuailed againÅ¿t y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rock wheron the kirk was builded, it preuailed againÅ¿t the Kirk. For, raze &amp; ouerturne the foundation of a houÅ¿e, the houÅ¿e cannot Å¿tand, Å¿eeing the Å¿tanding of the houÅ¿e conÅ¿iÅ¿ts on the firmneÅ¿Å¿e and Å¿ureneÅ¿Å¿e of the foundation thereof. Nowe the rocke whereon ye Å¿ay the Kirk is builded vnto whome this promiÅ¿e is made, is <hi>Peter and his Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ors the Popes of Rome,</hi> for Å¿o ye all with one conÅ¿ent expones the Å¿ame.

Now, I Å¿ay, that whilk may befall one kirk, may befall anie other kirk. Then that whilk is befallen to the kirk of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheÅ¿us,</hi> may befall any other: But the kirk of EpheÅ¿us was firÅ¿t craiÅ¿ed, and then by little and little quyte ouerthrowne: and beeing bereft of the light of ChriÅ¿t, is nowe a kirk no longer.

                     <p>Nowe I come to your laÅ¿t teÅ¿timonie of Scripture, Act. 5.39. In that counÅ¿ell of <hi>Gamaliel</hi> to the councill of the Scribes and PhariÅ¿ies, that <hi>if the doctrine of the ApoÅ¿tles be of God, that it cannot be deÅ¿troyed.</hi> What do ye gather heere?

It cannot (I graunt) be deÅ¿troied, but yet it can be perÅ¿ecuted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued out of places where it was before, and obÅ¿cured and corrupted by mens gloÅ¿Å¿es and traditions, as it hath bene this thouÅ¿and and fiue hundreth yeares by the Iewes, to whome this was Å¿poken. That if the doctrine of the ApoÅ¿tles was of God, they could not deÅ¿troy it: and yet (as was Å¿aide) they baniÅ¿hed it, and made the Lord to depriue them thereof, and to giue them ouer to the blindneÅ¿Å¿e and hardneÅ¿Å¿e of their hearts, becauÅ¿e they would not embrace the trueth when it was offered.</p>
                     <p>Seeing then there is not a Å¿illab in Gods word, that wil vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde this maine foundation of your kirk, (that <hi>the Kirk can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not erre</hi>) take heede to your Å¿elf, <hi>(M.

Great Å¿urelie muÅ¿t be that priuiledge giuen vnto the Kirk of Rome that hes exeemed

FirÅ¿t, then if <hi>Peters</hi> chaire hes Å¿uch an prerogatiue that the PaÅ¿tors who Å¿its in it and the Kirk that cleaues to it. can not erre. I think Å¿urely the Lords chaire whilk was at Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruÅ¿alem, whilk was called the Temple and Å¿eat of God, and <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> chair wherein the Scribes and PhariÅ¿es Å¿ate Å¿hould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue that prerogatiue to freeth the Kirkes and PaÅ¿tors Å¿itting in theÅ¿e chaires from erring, yea the kirk whilk the trueth it Å¿elfe IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t founded whom he taught with his owne mouth, and among whom he was crucified Å¿huld with far greater right clame to that prerogatiue. But Å¿ince al their Å¿eats hes erred, for the <hi>Temple became a den of theeues:</hi> The Scribes and PhariÅ¿es that Å¿ate in <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> chaire condemned the Lord of glorie: and IeruÅ¿alem it Å¿elfe cried out <hi>Crucifie crucifie him.</hi> And the chriÅ¿tian Kirk gathered there are long Å¿ince far from the way of Å¿aluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>. So that if neither the chair of God, nor <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> freed the Kirk of the Iewes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> erring, nor the chaire of ChriÅ¿t freed the chriÅ¿tian Kirk there gathered from erring. How then can <hi>Peters</hi> chaire haue this preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue aboue them al as to exeeme that Kirk and PaÅ¿tors that Å¿its therein from poÅ¿Å¿ibilitie of erring? What is this but to prefer him before them all, whoÅ¿e Å¿eat hes a priuiledge that neither God nor his Å¿onnes, nor <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> Å¿eat had? O high blaÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie to be deteÅ¿ted and abhorred of all chriÅ¿tian hartes. But let vs Å¿ee if it hes this prerogatiue whilk they aÅ¿criue vnto it, or not. And firÅ¿t if it could haue exemid any from er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, Å¿hould it not haue exemed himÅ¿elf eÅ¿pecially from er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring? But as it hes bene Å¿howen he erred. Therfore it can not exeeme neither his Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ors,
<note place="margin">Act. 1.6. Gal. 2</note> nor yet the Kirk that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges them, from erring. Secondly if it had exeemed any Kirk from erring, Å¿hould it not haue exeemed the Kirk of <hi>Antiochia</hi> eÅ¿pecially, for Å¿urely <hi>Antiochia</hi> hes better right to clame to this prerogatiue,
<note place="margin">Galat. 2 11.</note> nor your Kirk hes. For firÅ¿t it was <hi>Peters</hi> firÅ¿t Å¿eat. Next the Scripture bears witnes to it, that he was there. But neither was Rome Peters firÅ¿t Å¿eate, nor is

Here we might Å¿tay now and goe no further: for this Å¿ufficiently ouerthrowes this poynt of your doctrine, that the Kirk cannot erre, &amp; that be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿ion of the learnedÅ¿t of your Å¿ide. But yet I will perÅ¿ew the reÅ¿t. If you Å¿ay it is granted to the body, then it is either gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the people or to the Clergie. To the people, I trowe ye will not; for if your Popes may erre, much more may your people erre: And if he ApoÅ¿tles &amp; other famous Kirks may erre, much more may your people erre: yea, if not, it Å¿hould followe that your people were aboue their head the Pope, whilk I trowe ye will not Å¿ay. If yee Å¿ay the Clergie, then ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it muÅ¿t be your Doctors Å¿euerally by themÅ¿elues, or as they are gathered together in a councell. But as they are Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall ye will not Å¿ay. For your <hi>Bellarmines</hi> controuerÅ¿ies would conuince you to the face: for almoÅ¿t there are few controuerÅ¿ies whilk he handles (and he handles more nor 300) but hee brings in Å¿ome of your owne writers diÅ¿Å¿enting from him, and whome in many places he confutes. And I think if Popes hes not this priuiledge, Å¿urely the Doctors of your Kirk Å¿euerally hes not this priuiledge. But becauÅ¿e (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confeÅ¿Å¿eth <hi>if a generall councell erre, then the whole Kirk maye erre,</hi>

                     <p>As to your collection, the forme of it muÅ¿t be this. That Kirk onlie muÅ¿t be the trew Kirk that hes neuer bene inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, nor failed in any Å¿ubÅ¿tantiall head of faith and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion Å¿ince ChriÅ¿t and his ApoÅ¿tles. But Å¿ay ye, yours is Å¿uch, and ours not: Therefore your Kirk is the true Kirk, and ours not. The propoÅ¿ition I graunt. But all the controuerÅ¿ie lies in the probation of your aÅ¿Å¿umptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>. Yea, in Å¿tead of prouing ye Å¿ay it is not poÅ¿sible to mee, nor to na MiniÅ¿ter in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to aÅ¿signe to you the circumÅ¿tances of all mutations &amp; changes in your religion, as the perÅ¿on, time, place, &amp;c. And then ye attempt to aÅ¿signe al theÅ¿e circumÅ¿tances of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, vpon the whilk ye conclude the falÅ¿et of it. So we wil firÅ¿t Å¿ee how ye proue your owne, and then Å¿ee howe ye diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue ours. Indeed this argument of yours is of Å¿ik accompt with you, that there are not manie of your writers, but they haue Å¿et it, as it were, in the vaunt-guarde of their hoÅ¿te, and amongÅ¿t the greateÅ¿t of their Å¿trengthes and bulwarks, for to vp-holde their ruinous Babel. So <hi>Hammilton</hi> and <hi>Hay,</hi> in their demands to the MiniÅ¿ters of Scotland, Å¿o <hi>Campion,</hi> Å¿o <hi>Duraus Scotus</hi> againÅ¿t <hi>Whitaker</hi> in his defence:

But to anÅ¿were to your argument: firÅ¿t, I Å¿ay, If there be no mutations or changes in your Religion Å¿ince ChriÅ¿t &amp; his ApoÅ¿tles, then your religion and doctrine will be one with that quhilk is Å¿et downe in the Scripture of God. For you will not deny, I hope, but the Scripture doth Å¿ufficiently teÅ¿tifie, what doctrine and religion was in ChriÅ¿ts and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿tles dayes. And Å¿o let it once be put in the ballance of the Scripture, and tryed thereby, and then I hope it wil Å¿one be
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:20312:41"/> made manifeÅ¿t how far it is changed. So, and you dare, M. <hi>Gilbert</hi> let once your Religion be Å¿et vpon the Pannel, and let it once haue an aÅ¿Å¿yÅ¿e of the Scripture, and then the plea will end, I hope. Next I Å¿ay, it will not follow, We cannot aÅ¿signe all the circumÅ¿tances of changes in your Religion: Therefore your Religion is vncorrupted. For it Å¿ufficeth if we can proue the firÅ¿t onlie, that is, the matter or doctrine it Å¿elfe whilk is changed, and that by comparing it with the Scriptures of God, Å¿uppoÅ¿e we could not aÅ¿signe all the reÅ¿t of the circumÅ¿tances of the mutation: as the time, place, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and Å¿o forth: for the changes of manie things are moÅ¿te notorious, and yet all the circumÅ¿tances of the change ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of not knowne. We Å¿ay then it is not needfull to Å¿eeke the beginnings and circumÅ¿tances of the decayes and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in your Kirk, when the corruption and change it Å¿elfe is Å¿o manifeÅ¿t, by comparing your doctrine with the written worde of God, that it cannot be denied. For will you Å¿ay, that he who is deadlie diÅ¿eaÅ¿ed, is whole and Å¿ound, becauÅ¿e I cannot tell you the firÅ¿t article of time, the place, and firÅ¿t occaÅ¿ion of the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e? When it is manifeÅ¿t that a citty is full of miÅ¿order and confuÅ¿ion, wil ye Å¿ay that ye wil not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it to be Å¿o, vnleÅ¿Å¿e you knowe the firÅ¿t beginnings and progreÅ¿Å¿e of theÅ¿e miÅ¿orders. If you Å¿awe a ruinous houÅ¿e, would ye Å¿ay, Proue me and tell me all the circumÅ¿tances of the change of it, otherwiÅ¿e I will not beleeue it? Will ye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie that a Å¿hip could be drowned, vnleÅ¿Å¿e it were tolde you all the circumÅ¿ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ces of the change of the lecke where-throw it drowned. If any found a man faln in a pit, Å¿hall he not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that he is faln, whome neuertheleÅ¿Å¿e he Å¿ees to be ther, vnleÅ¿Å¿e it were tolde him, when and by whome he was caÅ¿te into the Å¿ame: Euen Å¿o, will ye not beleeue, or wil ye hinder al others to beleeue that your Kirk and Religion is ruinous, conÅ¿umed, rotten, dead, drowned, &amp; full of miÅ¿order, hereÅ¿y, and confuÅ¿ion, vnleÅ¿Å¿e the firÅ¿t beginnings of theÅ¿e changes can be tolde you? We Å¿ay therefore it is Å¿ufficient to proue the ruine and conÅ¿umption of your Kirk and Religion, if by comparing your doctrine with the truth of God in the Å¿crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:20312:42"/> we make euident the direct oppoÅ¿ition betwixt them, Å¿uppoÅ¿e wee coulde not aÅ¿signe all the circumÅ¿tances of the change of it out of the hiÅ¿tories, leauing it free to HiÅ¿torio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers to write what they pleaÅ¿e, and omitte what they pleaÅ¿e. Thirdlie, it is manifeÅ¿t, that the Kirk of the Iewes in the time of ChriÅ¿t was changed both in doctrine &amp; manners from that eÅ¿tate that it was in the time of <hi>Aaron, Eleazar,</hi> and Å¿undrie others: and alÅ¿o the Kirks of <hi>Galatia</hi> and <hi>Corinthe</hi> that they were changed from the eÅ¿tate wherein they were. And yet I trow that neither ye, nor any PapiÅ¿t in the earth is able to aÅ¿signe to me all the circumÅ¿tances of the mutations and changes in the Å¿ame, as the firÅ¿t authours, time, place, &amp;c. &amp; yet there was a great change in Doctrine and Religion in al theÅ¿e Kirks, as hath bene proued before. And we read that our Sauiour and the ApoÅ¿tles, conuicted them of a change, and yet they deÅ¿igned not the firÅ¿t authours, time, and place and Å¿o forth. The like I Å¿ay of the Kirk of <hi>Greece, AÅ¿ia</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frick,</hi> which in nomber exceedes yours. That there is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull change in their Kirk and Religion ye will not deny, or els your Religion is hereÅ¿ie: for (as Å¿aid is) they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge not your Popes Å¿upremacie, TranÅ¿ubÅ¿tantiation, &amp;c. And yet I trowe ye, nor na PapiÅ¿t in the earth is able to aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿igne al the circumÅ¿tances of changes in their Kirk, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which they haue preÅ¿entlie: yea, more vnable to doe this, nor we are able to doe the Å¿ame in yours. I meane not the hereÅ¿ies of <hi>Arrius, SamoÅ¿atenus, NeÅ¿torius, Eutyches, Sergius,</hi> and the reÅ¿t, whilk long ago were damned by the Councels of the Greek Kirks. (For I trow ye Å¿hal not be able to proue that they now maintain theÅ¿e hereÅ¿ies, whilk they condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and refuted long agoe.) But I meane of the preÅ¿ent er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and corruptions in their worÅ¿hip and Religion, whilk now they maintaine and profeÅ¿Å¿e. If then ye iudge the kirks of the eaÅ¿t heretical, becauÅ¿e they are not aggreable to your doctrine and Religion of Rome, and yet not be able to aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿igne the circumÅ¿tances of the changes and mutations of the Å¿ame? Will ye not grant the Å¿ame libertie to vs to accompt and iudge your kirk and Religion failed, becauÅ¿e it is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable

                     <p>Fourthlie I Å¿ay, if you haue read <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> there ye Å¿hall finde many hereÅ¿ies, whilk I omit for Å¿hortneÅ¿Å¿e, whilks he accompts hereÅ¿ies, whoÅ¿e beginnings and authours are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne.</p>

And therefore it is no wonder Å¿up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e the beginnings of infection and circumÅ¿tances of it, hes not bene marked: for if they had broken in all at once, and in a Å¿uddentie ouerthrowne the whole Kirk, it had bene no difficultie to haue aÅ¿Å¿igned the circumÅ¿tances of the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of it.

Now that ye are Å¿o skilled and acquainted with that hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tory of <hi>Martine Luther,</hi> that you can aÅ¿Å¿igne al theÅ¿e circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tances, it is no wonder, for that was the moÅ¿t notable and markable period of the decaying of your Babell, and of the erecting vp againe of the kingdome of IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, whilk your head &amp; clergie had Å¿tampt it vnder foote for Å¿o many yeares, whilk Å¿uppoÅ¿e the beginning of it was but like <hi>a little leauen, and as a graine of muÅ¿tard-Å¿eed whilk of all Å¿eedes is the leaÅ¿t.</hi> Yet now Å¿ince it hes Å¿o Å¿owred almoÅ¿t the whole maÅ¿Å¿e, euen the moÅ¿t part of the kingdomes of Europe, whilk once was vnder your Å¿pirituall bondage, and hes growen vp into Å¿ik a high tree hauing faire and great branches, vnder the whilk the Lords Å¿heepe may get reÅ¿te and warmneÅ¿Å¿e, and in the whilk his Å¿oules that mounts vp-wardes to that kingdome, doth builde their neÅ¿ts, Å¿o that neither can all your purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nor yet all your axes of fire and Å¿worde, of buls and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons of preachings and writtings, Å¿tay the Å¿preading of the one<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> nor cut downe the branches &amp; roote of the other. That <hi>M.

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:20312:47"/> obiection) but only raiÅ¿ed it out of the graue of darknes wherein ye had buried the trueth of God. Heere then (I Å¿ay) is the queÅ¿tion whether that religion whilk he preached hes the warrant from IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t in his TeÅ¿tament or not? the whilk if ye euer diÅ¿proue by the written word of God, then Å¿hall we grant you all that ye Å¿ay, the whilk is as impoÅ¿Å¿ible to you to doe, no not Å¿uppoÅ¿e your King would call all your wiÅ¿emen &amp; cleargie together,

Your reaÅ¿on then is this. The true Kirk of ChriÅ¿t hes neuerfailed vniuerÅ¿ally for the Å¿pace of one day, becauÅ¿e our Sauiour hes promiÅ¿ed to be with it to the end of the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:20312:48"/> world. But our Kirk was neuer before <hi>Martine Luthers</hi> daies, therefore it is not the true Kirk of ChriÅ¿t. As to your propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ition, if ye sake failing for erring in matters of doctrine, then I denie your propoÅ¿ition for I hope I haue proued Å¿uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently before that the Kirk both may erre and hes erred in all ages. But if you take failling to be vtterly aboliÅ¿hed and rooted out of the face of the earth, then I grant your propoÅ¿ition, that God hes euer a Kirk, the Kirk of his elect, with whom he will be to the end of the world. And as to your aÅ¿Å¿umption, that our Kirk was neuer before <hi>Martine Luthers</hi> dayes, I deny it. Let vs Å¿ee howe ye proue it. There was none (Å¿ay yee) before his daies neither viÅ¿ible nor inuiÅ¿ible that profeÅ¿Å¿ed his religion. But howe doe ye proue that, for that is Å¿till denied to you? For if our religion hes the olde and new TeÅ¿tament to beare witnes to it, and IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t to be the author of it in euerie poynt, as Å¿hall be made manifeÅ¿t by the grace of God, then I Å¿ay whoÅ¿oeuer they were from the beginning of the world to this day viÅ¿ible or inuiÅ¿ible that profeÅ¿Å¿ed the true IeÅ¿us, the true Sauiour, his true doctrine and Sacraments wherin religion Å¿tands, they are our prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ors, and are of our profeÅ¿Å¿ion and religion: Å¿o then ye Å¿hould firÅ¿t (if ye had gone Å¿quarely to work) haue diÅ¿proued the heads of our religion not to haue their warrand from the tables of ChriÅ¿ts TeÅ¿tament, or ye had concluded that we had none of our profeÅ¿Å¿ion and Religion before <hi>Martine Luther.</hi> And this is the point you Å¿hould haue begun at, for it is not the Kirk that makes the religion, but the religion that makes the Kirk. Haue we a warrant out of the word of God for our religion, then are we the true Kirk, and the Å¿ucceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ors of all them who euer from the beginning of the vvorld hes profeÅ¿Å¿ed the Å¿ame. Haue vve not this vvarrant then I graunt you vve haue no true Kirk. So there is the point of our controuerÅ¿ie, vvhether our doctrine be from God, out of his vvord or not.

                     <p>Your next proofe is taken from an teÅ¿timonie of one of our owne writers where ye alledge that it is written of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Luther</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> that they were the firÅ¿t that came to the knowledge of the GoÅ¿pell.

So that this worde <hi>primum</hi> that is, firÅ¿t, is not in compariÅ¿on with them that knew the GoÅ¿pell before, but in compariÅ¿on with that time in the whilk they themÅ¿elues knew not the GoÅ¿pell.

For not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns it preÅ¿ent hereÅ¿ies, but alÅ¿o the hereÅ¿ies that was to

And Å¿eing PapiÅ¿trie is that AntichriÅ¿tian religion, as Å¿hall be made manifeÅ¿t by Gods grace: therefore it hes the expreÅ¿Å¿e condemnation of it in the word of God. The forme therefore of it, no wayes will make it impoÅ¿Å¿ible to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. As for the next thing, that I proue nothing, but offers verie faire. I anÅ¿wer it was not my purpoÅ¿e then, but I hope ye Å¿hall haue a proofe now of that whilk I offered then. As to the third then, that I can Å¿ay nothing to your argument whilk ye would haue the reader to marke: vvhen I red this, I marked this, that ye would earneÅ¿tly haue the reader per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿waded of the inuinciblenes of your argument and my ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie to anÅ¿were. But what bring ye with you to perÅ¿wade him of the Å¿ame? Your reaÅ¿on is, becauÅ¿e I haue not anÅ¿wered it. Will this follow, I haue not (Å¿uppoÅ¿e it were Å¿o as yee Å¿ay) therefore I cannot? It will not follow (M. <hi>Gilbert</hi>) I haue not anÅ¿wered, I cannot anÅ¿were to it. But as ye haue a new Theologie, Å¿o haue ye a newe Logick. But Å¿aid I nothing to your argument? What is not anÅ¿vvered Å¿ufficiently in the Å¿ame? Your argument vvas the antiquitie of your religion and continuance of it from ChriÅ¿t by a lineall Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ion neuer interrupted, &amp;c. And the noueltie of ours. My anÅ¿wer vvas: yours vvas not inÅ¿titute by ChriÅ¿t nor his ApoÅ¿tles in his Scripture as ours vvas, and yours vvas gaineÅ¿aide in the cheif poynts by the teÅ¿timonies of the fathers the firÅ¿t 600. yeares, and the principall points of our religion confirmed by Å¿undrie of their teÅ¿timonies. Thirdly yours vvas that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriÅ¿tian apoÅ¿tacie that the Scripture fore-tolde Å¿hould come, and in the height of your tyrannie and Idolatrie vvas gainÅ¿ayed by many before <hi>Martine Luther,</hi> and ours vvas profeÅ¿Å¿ed by Å¿undry before him vvhoÅ¿e names I Å¿et dovvne, all vvhilk I offered to proue, and novve Å¿hall doe by Gods grace. Novv you Å¿ay this is no anÅ¿vvere. But is that no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿vver that cuts the verie throte of your religion if it be vere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, &amp; hoghs your argument, that it doe neuer Å¿tand vp to vnder-propp your religion againe? For that religion vvhilk is not inÅ¿tituted by ChriÅ¿t in the Scripture, vvhoÅ¿e maine foundations is gainÅ¿aide by the teÅ¿timonies of Å¿undrie of the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:20312:51"/> fathers of the firÅ¿t 600. yeare whilk is AntichriÅ¿tian, and whilk was gaineÅ¿aid by the Saints that they perÅ¿ecuted and Å¿lew, hes not the continuance from ChriÅ¿t by a lineal Å¿ucceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion neuer interrupted nor Å¿poken againÅ¿t by a true Kirk till <hi>Martine Luthers</hi> dayes. This I am Å¿ure ye will not deny. But your religion is Å¿ik as I offered then to proue, and now hes in Å¿ome poynts, and Å¿hall in other Å¿ome poynts by Gods grace. The whilk if it be verifyed, then I hope ye will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but that your religion hes neither antiquitie, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance nor Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ion from ChriÅ¿t til <hi>Martine Luthers</hi> dayes. And that religion cannot be newly forged and inuented Å¿ince <hi>Martine Luthers</hi> dayes, whilk hes the warrant and inÅ¿titution of it in the Scripture &amp;c. This you cannot deny. But our religion is Å¿ik, as then I offered to proue and now hes done in Å¿ome poynts and Å¿hall doe in other Å¿ome poynts by Gods grace. Therefore our religion cannot be newly forged and inuented &amp;c. but is the only true religion. So that this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿were if it be proued, doth Å¿ufficiently vindicat our religion fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> noueltie. Now if this be no anÅ¿were to your argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> I Å¿ay no more, but ye will anÅ¿wer it the Å¿ooner.

But this you doe, becauÅ¿e you knowe that if ye reiected the Scripture as far in worde, as ye do in deed, the conÅ¿ciences of the poore people would at the laÅ¿t withdrawe themÅ¿elues from vnder your tyranny, and would goe out of your fellowÅ¿hip for the Å¿afety of their Å¿oules: Å¿o vnder the cloak and pretence of the Scripture, ye keepe them in your communion.

                     <p>FirÅ¿t, ye begin at the neceÅ¿sitie of the Sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiÅ¿me, whereof ye affirme that it is Å¿o neceÅ¿Å¿arie, that infants cannot come to heauen without the Å¿ame. As for BaptiÅ¿me we graunt that it is a moÅ¿t effectuall Å¿eale and pledge of our ingrafting in ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us, and of the remiÅ¿sion of our Å¿innes through his blood, &amp; regeneratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> through his Spirit, Å¿o that either the neglect or the contempt of it, (becauÅ¿e it is the ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>glect and contempt of the couenaunt it Å¿elfe, and of ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us the foundation of the couenant) is damnable. But that it is Å¿o abÅ¿olutelie neceÅ¿Å¿arie to infants, that without it they cannot come to heauen: to wit, theÅ¿e whome he hes prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tinate, it being neither neglected nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>temned, but death preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ting the receiuing of it: that we allutterly deny as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, vngodlie, and cruell. For firÅ¿t I Å¿ay there is none that is in the couenant of grace, &amp; who hes God to be their god, and are holy, that can periÅ¿h. This you cannot deny. But the children of the faithfull who are of his Å¿ecret election are Å¿ik before they be baptiÅ¿ed. And this I proue. The Lord promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed to <hi>Abraham I will be thy God and the God of thy Å¿eede.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen, 17, 17 Act, 2, 39. 2, Cor, 7, 14</note> And this Peter alÅ¿o teÅ¿tifies, <hi>The promiÅ¿e</hi> (Å¿aieth he) <hi>is made to you &amp; to your children.</hi> And the ApoÅ¿tle Å¿ayes, <hi>that the children of the faithfull are holie:</hi> Therefore the children of the faithfull who are of Gods Å¿ecret election, Å¿uppoÅ¿e they die without Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiÅ¿me, doth not periÅ¿he. Secondlie, if BaptiÅ¿me were abÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutelie neceÅ¿Å¿arie to Å¿aluation, then the grace of God were bound to the Sacrament. This cannot be denied. But your MaiÅ¿ter of Å¿entences Å¿ayes, that the grace of God is not bound to the Sacraments, and it is impious Å¿o to thinke, that Gods free grace and Å¿aluation is bound to the inÅ¿trument. Thirdlie, if CircumciÅ¿ion was not abÅ¿olutely neceÅ¿Å¿arie to Å¿al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uation in the old TeÅ¿tament, then BaptiÅ¿me is not abÅ¿olute neceÅ¿Å¿arie now, becauÅ¿e CircumciÅ¿ion was as Å¿traitly enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to them, as BaptiÅ¿me is enioyned to vs, and BaptiÅ¿me is Å¿ucceded in the roome of the Å¿ame, but CircumciÅ¿ion is not abÅ¿olute neceÅ¿Å¿arie. For <hi>Lombardus</hi> is rebuked by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of <hi>Paris</hi> becauÅ¿e he Å¿o thought. And <hi>Dauid</hi> doubtes not
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:20312:59"/> to Å¿ay of his childe who died the Å¿euenth day, and Å¿o before he was circumciÅ¿ed, <hi>I Å¿hall goe to him, &amp;c.</hi> and Å¿o he pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that he was Å¿aued: and al the time that they were in the wilderneÅ¿Å¿e, almoÅ¿t 40. yeares, CircumciÅ¿ion was neglected, whilk plainlie Å¿howes, that it was not Å¿o abÅ¿olute neceÅ¿Å¿arie, that Å¿aluation could not be obtained without it. Therefore BaptiÅ¿me is not Å¿o abÅ¿olute neceÅ¿Å¿arie to Å¿aluation, as ye Å¿up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e: for the grace of God is of no leÅ¿Å¿e force in the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tament, nor it was in the olde. Fourtlie, we read of Å¿undry that receiued the holy GhoÅ¿t before they were baptized, &amp; Å¿eing the holy GhoÅ¿t where he is, regenerates to eternal life: Therefore life eternall is not bound abÅ¿olutelie to BaptiÅ¿me Fiftlie, what a croÅ¿Å¿e and diÅ¿turbance is this, that your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine brings to the conÅ¿ciences of all theÅ¿e parents, whoÅ¿e children hes bene preuented by death, before they could be offered to be baptized? if they beleeue your doctrine, how often will this come in their minde, that their children are damned. And Å¿eeing the infants themÅ¿elues are not in the cauÅ¿e that they are not baptized, but their death preuenting by Gods prouidence, or the Parents neglecting or contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Å¿ame, or perÅ¿ecution, or one impediment or other hindering, wherefore are ye Å¿o cruell to iudge them to bee damned for that, whereof themÅ¿elues are cauÅ¿leÅ¿Å¿e? And laÅ¿t of all, if ye be acquainted in the hiÅ¿tories of the Kirk of God in the firÅ¿t age, ye will finde many that delayed to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, vntill their latter age, whilk they would neuer haue done and they had thought it Å¿impliciter neceÅ¿Å¿arie to Å¿alua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as ye doe. And <hi>AmbroÅ¿ius</hi> doubts not to Å¿ay that <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinian wanted not the grace of BaptiÅ¿me, Å¿uppoÅ¿e he wanted BaptiÅ¿me it Å¿elf:</hi> the whilk he would neuer haue Å¿aide, if he had thoght it abÅ¿olutely neceÅ¿Å¿arie to Å¿aluation. And <hi>Bernard</hi> Å¿ayes, <hi>I can not altogether deÅ¿paire of the Å¿aluation of them who wants BaptiÅ¿me not through contempt, but onlie through impoÅ¿Å¿ibilitie to get it.</hi> And in that Å¿ame place hee Å¿ayes. <hi>So alÅ¿o if our Sauiour ChriÅ¿t for this cauÅ¿e. When he had Å¿aide, hee that beleeueth and is BaptiÅ¿ed Å¿hall bee Å¿aued: did of purpoÅ¿e in repeating the Å¿entence, omit to Å¿ay: Hee that is not BaptiÅ¿ed, but he that beleeueth not Å¿hall bee damned, for hee Å¿aw
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:20312:59" rendition="simple:additions"/> that faith only might Å¿uffice to Å¿aluation, and without faith nothing can Å¿uffice.</hi> IuÅ¿tly then might your Popes Å¿entence and your own be Å¿aid to be cruell, in our confeÅ¿sion. But how proue ye this doctrine of yours to be ChriÅ¿ts? Ye cite the three chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Iohn</hi> where our Sauiour Å¿aies, <hi>Except a man be borne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine &amp;c.</hi> vvhilk Å¿ay ye is properly meaned of the Å¿acrament of baptiÅ¿me. Vpon the whilk ye infer the neceÅ¿Å¿itie of the Å¿ame. Whereunto I anÅ¿were that interpretation of yours is falÅ¿e: for our Sauiour Å¿peakes not here of the Å¿acrament of BaptiÅ¿me: and that for theÅ¿e reaÅ¿ons: firÅ¿te, our Sauiour Å¿peaks here generally of al men, and not of infants only, and therefore he Å¿ayes, <hi>Except a man be borne &amp;c.</hi> Å¿peaking to <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codemus</hi> who was a man and not an infant, Å¿o that if your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ition were true all men that died without baptiÅ¿me and not infants only, are excluded from heauen. But that is falÅ¿e: for firÅ¿t the good theef was not baptiÅ¿ed with water, and yet our Sauiour Å¿aide to him, <hi>this might thou Å¿halt be with me in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiÅ¿e.</hi> And therefore our Sauiour Å¿peakes not here of the Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of baptiÅ¿me: for he Å¿peakes of that new birth by water and the Å¿pirit without the whilk none can be Å¿aued: but this theefe and others were Å¿aued without the baptiÅ¿me of water: therefore he Å¿peakes not here of it. Next our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour in that place Å¿peakes of that new birth by the Å¿pirit &amp; water whilk is Å¿o abÅ¿olutely neceÅ¿Å¿arie to the Å¿aluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of al men that it admits no exception. This cannot be denyed. But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> makes two exceptions againÅ¿t the abÅ¿olute neceÅ¿Å¿itie of baptiÅ¿me: one of martyrdome, the other of true conuerÅ¿ion and pennance,
<note place="margin">Lib, 1, de BaptiÅ¿, cap. 6</note> whereof (Å¿ayes he) either of them Å¿upplies the want of baptiÅ¿me. Therfore our Sauiour Å¿peakes not here of the Å¿acrament of baptiÅ¿me. Thirdly if we will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us expounding him-Å¿elfe, and Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding Scripture, I Å¿ay, by water is not alwaies meaned the Å¿acrament of baptiÅ¿me: but the purifying grace of ChriÅ¿t whilk is called the water of life, Å¿o our Sauiour Å¿peakes in the 4. chapter of <hi>Iohn</hi> verÅ¿e 11. &amp; 7. chapter verÅ¿e 38, And in that Å¿ame Å¿enÅ¿e water is here added to the Å¿pirit to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the more Å¿enÅ¿ibly the efficacie of the Å¿pirit in waÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:20312:60"/> and clenÅ¿ing vs, as fire is added to the Å¿pirit in the 3. of <hi>Matthew.</hi> 11. verÅ¿. He will baptize you with the Å¿pirit and with fire, whilk is not properly vnderÅ¿toode of any naturall fire, but taken figuratiuely to expound more Å¿enÅ¿ibly the force and eficacie of the Å¿pirit in burning vp our corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>Fourthlye, what an abÅ¿urd thing were this whilk Å¿houlde follow if your expoÅ¿ition were true, that for the want of the Å¿prinkling of a little water, the infants Å¿hould periÅ¿he that are in the couenant, Å¿eing they were not the cauÅ¿e of the want of it. Further, I Å¿ay, that Å¿uppoÅ¿e baptiÅ¿me were here meaned: yet there is no Å¿ik neceÅ¿Å¿itie as ye Å¿uppoÅ¿e, for if martyrdome and pennance may Å¿upply the want of this wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confeÅ¿Å¿es) how much more may the holye GhoÅ¿t Å¿upply the want of the Å¿ame in infants: and if anye thing may Å¿upply the want of it, then it is not Å¿o abÅ¿olutely neceÅ¿Å¿ary that al theÅ¿e infants are damned that wants it.</p>

Secondly, he Å¿peakes of that eating and drinking of his fleÅ¿h and blood, whilk who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿oeuer Å¿o doth, hath eternall life to themÅ¿elues: Å¿o our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour ChriÅ¿t promiÅ¿es in the 54. verÅ¿e. But your owne do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is, that the reprobate eates and drinkes ChriÅ¿ts body &amp; blood in the Å¿acrament, and yet hes no life in them: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he Å¿peaks not heere of that Å¿acramental eating. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, if he Å¿peake heere of the Å¿acramentall eating as you Å¿ay, then your Kirk not onlie hes erred foullie, but alÅ¿o hes bene and is the cauÅ¿e of the condemnation of your people theÅ¿e
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:20312:66"/> manie yeares, becauÅ¿e you giue them not his blood to drink And our Sauiour Å¿ayes not onlie, <hi>Except ye eate the fleÅ¿h of the Å¿onne of man,</hi> but alÅ¿o, <hi>except ye drink his blood, ye haue no life in you.</hi> And this reaÅ¿on was Å¿o effectuall, that it hes moued Å¿undrie of your own Doctors to expone this place, not of the Å¿acra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall eating and drinking of the bodie &amp; blood of ChriÅ¿t,
<note place="margin">As IanÅ¿enius &amp; Tapperus with Å¿undrie others.</note> but of the Å¿pirituall eating and drinking of him by faith. For they did Å¿e that it behoued them either to forÅ¿ake this place, as not making for them, and graunt that it Å¿peakes not of the Å¿acrament: or elÅ¿e to confeÅ¿Å¿e that their Kirk hes erred, and through this error, hes bene the cauÅ¿e of the damnation of manie, in miniÅ¿tring the Å¿acrament but vnder one kinde. And becauÅ¿e you Å¿ay, if our expoÅ¿itions were remoued from the Scripture, they would Å¿erue for you: whome therefore will you credite in exponing of this place? If our Sauiour, heare then howe he expones this eating and drinking of his fleÅ¿h and blood in the 35. verÅ¿e. <hi>I am the bread of life, hee that commeth vnto me Å¿hall not hunger, and he that beleeues in me Å¿hal ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thirÅ¿t.</hi> So when we beleeue in ChriÅ¿t, we eate him: and when we come vnto him, (whilk is only by faith) we drinke him.

                     <p>The next place ye quote, is the words of the inÅ¿titution,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:20312:67"/> as <hi>Matthew, Marke, Luke,</hi> and the ApoÅ¿t. rehearÅ¿es them. Your argument is this: ChriÅ¿t calles the bread his fleÅ¿he, (and Å¿o <hi>Paule</hi>) and the wine his blood: therefore the bread is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in his bodie, and the wine in his blood, the outwarde formes of bread and wine onlie remaining. This is the chiefe and principall ground of your reall preÅ¿ence and TranÅ¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tantiation. Whereunto I anÅ¿were: FirÅ¿t, there is not a Å¿il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable heere that telles vs that the Å¿ubÅ¿tance of the bread and wine is tranÅ¿-changed in the bodie and blood of ChriÅ¿t, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leÅ¿Å¿e ye will expone this word, <hi>is my bodie,</hi> for, it is changed in my bodie,
<note place="margin">EÅ¿t &amp; Fieri, Å¿unt contraria</note> whilk is a monÅ¿trous expoÅ¿ition: for both it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the natiue Å¿ignification of the worde <hi>est;</hi> that Å¿igni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies to be alreadie: (for to be alreadie, and to be in a change are contrarie) as alÅ¿o it hes not the like forme of Å¿peache in the whole Scripture to vvarrand it: from the firÅ¿t of <hi>GeneÅ¿is,</hi> to the laÅ¿t of the <hi>Reuelation.</hi> (Bring one inÅ¿tance if yee can.)

                        <hi>the Å¿olution of a queÅ¿tion Å¿hould be warranted by Å¿ome example of the like Å¿peache in the Scripture,</hi> the whilk you are not able to do: therfore your expoÅ¿ition is without war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand. Next I Å¿ay: By what arte of reaÅ¿oning can you gather this doctrine out of theÅ¿e places of Scripture? ChriÅ¿t Å¿ayes of the breade, <hi>This is my bodie,</hi> and of the wyne, <hi>This is my bloode.</hi> Therefore the outwarde formes of the breade and wyne on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie remaines, but the Å¿ubÅ¿tance of them is gone. Neuer Å¿ik a inkling in all theÅ¿e texts of this doctrine of yours. Thirdlie, this interpretation and doctrine whilk reÅ¿ults vpon it, is fals, and that for theÅ¿e reaÅ¿ons. FirÅ¿t, becauÅ¿e it is plainely gaine-Å¿aide by the Scripture. Secondly, becauÅ¿e it deÅ¿troyes Å¿un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie articles of our faith, and many blaÅ¿phemous abÅ¿urdities doth follow vpon it. 3. It deÅ¿troyes the nature of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And laÅ¿t of all, is vtterly repugnant to the words of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inÅ¿titution. My argument then is this. That interpretation &amp; doctrine whilk is gaine-Å¿aide, by the plaine teÅ¿timonie of the Scripture, whilk deÅ¿troyes the articles of our faith, and the fundamentall poyntes of our Å¿aluation, whilk hes many ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿urdities following vpon it, whilk ouerthrovves the nature of the Sacrament, and laÅ¿t of all, vvhilk is contrarie to the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:20312:67"/> whole inÅ¿titution, muÅ¿t be falÅ¿e, blaÅ¿phemous and erroneous. This cannot be denyed but your interpretation of theÅ¿e wordes <hi>this is my bodye &amp;c.</hi> and your tranÅ¿ubÅ¿tantiation whilk ye gather vpon it, is Å¿ik. Therefore it muÅ¿t be errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous &amp;c. My aÅ¿Å¿umption I proue thus. FirÅ¿t your interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is gainÅ¿aide by the plaine teÅ¿timony of the Scripture. Your interpretation is that there remaines no true bread nor wine in the Å¿acrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t, but the Å¿ubÅ¿tance of it is changed. But <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew, Mark, Luke.</hi> and the ApoÅ¿tles all foure teÅ¿tifies that <hi>ChriÅ¿t tooke bread, brake it, &amp; gaue it to his DiÅ¿ciples,</hi> &amp; leaÅ¿t ye Å¿huld Å¿ay y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was true bread &amp; wine before the conÅ¿ecration,
<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.16,</note> but not after, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Å¿cripture Å¿aies planely <hi>that it is bread</hi> whilk we <hi>brake,</hi> &amp; <hi>bread whilk is eaten, and the frute of the Vine whilk is drunken</hi> in the Å¿acrament. The ApoÅ¿tles Å¿aies, <hi>the bread whilk we brake &amp;c. And as oft as ye eate this bread &amp;c. WhoÅ¿oeuer Å¿hall eate this bread &amp;c. And let a man examine him Å¿elfe, and Å¿o let him eate of this bread &amp;c.</hi> And our Sauiour Å¿ayes, that after he had giuen the cup and they had drunken of it, <hi>from hence forth Å¿hall I not drink of the frutes of the wine with you &amp;c.</hi> Therefore true bread and wine remaines in the Å¿acrament, contrarie expreÅ¿ly to your interpretation. 2. That your interpretation deÅ¿troyes the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of our faith, I proue it thus. If this be true that the bread and wine be really changed in the bodie and blood of ChriÅ¿t in the Å¿acrament, as ye expound the words: firÅ¿t it will followe that either ChriÅ¿t aÅ¿cended not into heauen, becauÅ¿e he remayneth in the earth in the Å¿acrament: and Å¿o one of the articles of our beleefe is falÅ¿ified. Or els, if ye Å¿ay he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cended once, but yet diÅ¿cends continually to be preÅ¿ent in the Å¿acrament, then another article of our beleefe is falÅ¿ified whilk Å¿aith, <hi>that he Å¿itteth at the right hand of God his father.</hi>

Fifthly it will follow that his body is Å¿eparate from his Å¿oule, and Å¿o a dead bodie, becauÅ¿e the bread and wine are not changed in his Å¿oule, but only in his bodie.

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:20312:69"/> be? Å¿eing it is bread al the time while he tooke it, bleÅ¿Å¿ed it, and gaue it, and they did eate. For, I trow, ye will not Å¿ay it is changed after it is broken, and giuen, and in eating. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condlie, I will aske you, what are the wordes whereby this monÅ¿trous change is made, as ye Å¿uppoÅ¿e, of the Å¿ubÅ¿tance of the bread, in ChriÅ¿ts bodie? If this change be made by anie word Å¿poken in the inÅ¿titution of this Sacrament: then, I Å¿ay it muÅ¿t either be by this word: <hi>And he bliÅ¿Å¿ed it:</hi> or by theÅ¿e words, <hi>This is my bodie, &amp;c.</hi> But not by the firÅ¿t: for after he bliÅ¿Å¿ed it, he called it bread. And the ApoÅ¿tle Å¿ayes it is bread whilk wee brake, therefore it remaines bread after the bliÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ing. Not by the other words: for if they be not Å¿poken to the breade and wine, they cannot change their nature: But <hi>Marke</hi> Å¿ayes plainly they were Å¿poken to the DiÅ¿ciples, <hi>And he Å¿aide vnto them, This is my blood:</hi>

                        </note> therefore they changed not their nature. And <hi>Durand</hi> a PapiÅ¿t Å¿aies, <hi>that this change is made by the bleÅ¿sing,</hi> therefore not by theÅ¿e words whilk were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced after the bleÅ¿sing. And theÅ¿e words cannot worke a change:
<note place="margin">GeneÅ¿. Ioh. 12</note> for they are not words importing an operation as theÅ¿e are, <hi>Let light be: let the earth bring forth fruit, come out Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> and Å¿ik-like: but onlie Å¿ignifying the things themÅ¿elues, as theÅ¿e are, <hi>Thou art my welbeloued Sonne.</hi> So if theÅ¿e wordes Å¿houlde haue wrought anie change, they woulde not haue bene <hi>This is my body &amp;c.</hi> but Let this be my bodie: therefore there is no Å¿ik change at all heir as ye imagine. Thirdlie, it Å¿hould followe that the Cup Å¿hould alÅ¿o be changed in his blood, and in the new TeÅ¿tament, becauÅ¿e ChriÅ¿t calles the Cup his blood and newe TeÅ¿tament, as he calles the bread his bodie. But this you will not Å¿ay: wherefore then are you Å¿o abÅ¿urd as to Å¿ay the other. Fourthlie, I will aske you whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do ye receaue in the Sacrament that body whilk is mor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tall, or that body whilk is glorified: for one of them you muÅ¿t receaue: either ChriÅ¿ts bodie as it was mortal, or his body as it is now glorified. If ye Å¿ay a mortall bodie, then I Å¿ay ChriÅ¿t hes not a mortall bodie to giue you now in the Sacrament, for it is glorified: therefore ye cannot receiue it: if ye Å¿ay an immortall and glorified bodie, then I Å¿ay, ye muÅ¿t Å¿eeke an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:20312:70"/> warrand nor this text of <hi>Matthew, Mark,</hi> and <hi>Luke.</hi> For at that time his bodie was not glorified. For the Sacrament was inÅ¿tituted before his death, and he was not glorified vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till after his reÅ¿urrection: and if ye receiue that Å¿ame body whilk the ApoÅ¿tles then receiued: then, ye receiue not a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified body. What a body is this then whilk ye receiue, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mortall nor glorified? Fifthlie, the text Å¿ayes, they <hi>who receiues vnworthelie, receiues their owne damnation:</hi> But if ChriÅ¿tes fleÅ¿h and blood were there preÅ¿ent, as ye Å¿ay: then al who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued it Å¿hould receiue their Å¿aluation, becauÅ¿e our Sauiour Å¿ayes,
<note place="margin">Ioh. 6.54</note> 
                        <hi>He that eates my fleÅ¿he and drinke, my blood hath lyfe euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ting.</hi> Now I conclude, Å¿eing your interpretation of theÅ¿e pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture, and your doctrine of TranÅ¿ubÅ¿tantiation whilk ye gather thereupon, firÅ¿t is plainlie gain-Å¿aide by the expreÅ¿Å¿e teÅ¿timonies of the Scripture, next ouerthrowes all the maine foundations of our Å¿aluation, and articles of our faith: thirdlie deÅ¿troyes the nature of a Sacrament and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it no Sacrament at all, and like no other Sacrament ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the olde or new TeÅ¿tament, and laÅ¿t of all is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the whole inÅ¿titution thereof, as, I hope, I haue Å¿uffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entlie prooued: therefore of neceÅ¿sitie it muÅ¿t be falÅ¿e &amp; er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous.</p>
                     <p>As for the 10. of the <hi>Corinth.</hi> 16. <hi>The Cup of bliÅ¿sing whilk wee bliÅ¿Å¿e, is it not the communication, and the bread whilk we breake, is it not &amp;c.</hi> I anÅ¿were: this Sacrament of bread and wine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e it not onlie repreÅ¿ents and Å¿eales vp to vs our commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion both with ChriÅ¿t: but alÅ¿o by it, as by a moÅ¿t effectual inÅ¿tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the holy GhoÅ¿t increaÅ¿es &amp; nouriÅ¿hes this communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, both with him, and amongÅ¿t our Å¿elues: therefore it is called the communication of his bodie and blood. But this moÅ¿t clearlie proues, that there is no Å¿ik change heir as ye Å¿uppoÅ¿e: for the ApoÅ¿t. Å¿ayes plainlie, <hi>the bread whilk we break,</hi> and this breaking you Å¿ay is after the conÅ¿ecration: therfore after the conÅ¿ecration true bread remains in the Sacrament and Å¿o there is no TranÅ¿ubÅ¿tantiation in the Å¿ame. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e you Å¿ay the Å¿ubÅ¿tance of the bread &amp; wine is not there I pray you tell me whither are they gone? whether are they
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:20312:70"/> turned to nothing, or are they changed in ChriÅ¿ts bodie. If you Å¿ay they are turned to nothing: firÅ¿te, I Å¿ay this were a Å¿trange kinde of reaÅ¿oning: <hi>This is my bodie,</hi> therefore the Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tance of the bread is turned to nothing: next the ApoÅ¿tle Å¿hould not Å¿peake truelie, to call it <hi>bread whilk is broken, and bread whilk is eaten, &amp;c.</hi> if it were turned to nothing. Thirdly then this Å¿hould not be called TranÅ¿ubÅ¿tantiation, or chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of one Å¿ubÅ¿tance into another: but an annihilation of one Å¿ubÅ¿tance, that is, a turning of it to nothing, and a bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of another Å¿ubÅ¿tance in the roome of it. And fourthly <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquine,</hi>

                        </note> your great defender of this doctrine is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t this. But if you Å¿ay, they are turned in ChriÅ¿ts bodie, whilk the word TranÅ¿ubÅ¿tantiation imports: then, I Å¿ay, as oft as the Sacrament hes bene miniÅ¿trated, as oft hes there bene Å¿ome quantitie of Å¿ubÅ¿tance ciked to his bodie: and it Å¿hall Å¿till grow in greatnes and quantitie, as long as it Å¿hall be miniÅ¿tred: but this is monÅ¿trous to thinke. And to end this, if you Å¿ay there is no Å¿ubÅ¿tance of bread and wine left in the Sacrament, then let me aske you whoÅ¿e are the white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e, and readneÅ¿Å¿e, and roundneÅ¿Å¿e that we Å¿ee: What meanes this taiÅ¿t in our mouthes of bread and wine, if there be no Å¿ubÅ¿tance of them there. May we not Å¿ay to you as ChriÅ¿t Å¿aide to <hi>Thomas,</hi> who doubted of his reÅ¿urrection, <hi>Put thy finger heir, beholde my handes, put thy hand in my Å¿ide, and be not incredulous but beleeue.</hi> So, may not we Å¿ay to you, who doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth whether the Å¿ubÅ¿tance of bread &amp; wine be heir remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning yet, touch them, taiÅ¿t them, looke on them, and feele them, and be not incredulous, but beleeue. For beholde, there would not be Å¿ik a coullour, Å¿ik a taiÅ¿t and Å¿mell, and there were not Å¿ubÅ¿tance of bread and wine heir. And I pray you tel me what is this that rottes then &amp; growes in Mauks in the bread, and Å¿owers in the wine, if they be long kept? If their Å¿ubÅ¿tance remaineth not, will you Å¿ay ChriÅ¿ts fleÅ¿h and blood rots and conÅ¿umes &amp; Å¿owers, what is this but to mak him mortall, yea to crucifie him againe. And if you will not Å¿ay that, then either muÅ¿t you confeÅ¿Å¿e that their Å¿ubÅ¿tance remaines and is not changed, or els ChriÅ¿ts fleÅ¿h and blood
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:20312:71"/> is tranÅ¿ubÅ¿tantiated in theÅ¿e Å¿ubÅ¿tances whilk rots &amp; Å¿owres, or els that the accidents is changed againe in their Å¿ubÅ¿tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: &amp; Å¿o ye Å¿hall not haue one, but maa changes in your Sacrament. Yea, if their Å¿ubÅ¿tance be gone, and nothing but their accidents remaining, then how could Pope <hi>Victor</hi> the 3. and the Emperour <hi>Henrie</hi> the 7. haue bene poyÅ¿oned with them,
<note place="margin">FaÅ¿ciculus temp.

Vpon the whilk I reaÅ¿on thus, this propoÅ¿ition is true, <hi>this is my bodie whilk is broken for you.</hi> So the ApoÅ¿tle Å¿ayes, but ChriÅ¿ts bodie was not broken then reallie, for not a bone of him was broken at all, as the Scripture teÅ¿tifies:
<note place="margin">Exod 12. Ioh, 19,</note> and the Scripture Å¿ayes and all men confeÅ¿Å¿es that he Å¿uffered but once, Å¿o only his Å¿ufferings ar Å¿ignified then by the breaking of the bread in the Å¿acrament here: Å¿o as ChriÅ¿ts bodie was not broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> then reallie, that is, Å¿uffered: but his Å¿uffering only Å¿ignified by the breaking of the bread, Å¿o his bodie was not giuen reallie and corporallie to be eaten, but only Å¿ignified. Secondly, I Å¿ay, it is true, that ChriÅ¿ts naturall bodie was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered to the death for vs: but yet it will not followe vpon this, that it was his naturall bodie whilk hee gaue to them to be eaten corporallie: for his naturall bodie was reallie deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to death for vs: and it was but giuen to them Å¿piritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie to be eaten. You muÅ¿te coyne a newe Logick M. <hi>Gilbert</hi> or you can make theÅ¿e two Å¿ticke together: and the one ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿arilie to follow vpon the other. For by that Å¿ame reaÅ¿on
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:20312:74"/> you may aÅ¿well conclude, that ChriÅ¿t gaue his naturall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to be eaten corporallie in the worde, for hee giues him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elfe to
<note n="a)" place="margin">Ioh. 6.35 Bellarm grants this alÅ¿o lib. 1. de EuchariÅ¿t. cap. 7.</note> be eaten in his worde aÅ¿well as in his Sacrament, and alÅ¿o he giues that Å¿ame body to them in the word, whilk was deliuered to death: for the Å¿elfe Å¿ame ChriÅ¿te is offered and receiued aÅ¿well in the worde as in the Sacrament. So from his bodilie death, to a corporal eating of him, it wil not follow. And further by that Å¿ame reaÅ¿on you may aÅ¿well Å¿ay that the fathers before ChriÅ¿t vnder the law, did eate ChriÅ¿ts bodie corporallie, for they eate that Å¿ame Å¿pirituall foode, &amp; drank that Å¿ame Å¿pirituall drink, in their Sacraments, whilk we doe now in ours. So the ApoÅ¿tle teÅ¿tifies, euen that Å¿elfe Å¿ame ChriÅ¿t his bodie and blood whiilk was deliuered to the death, &amp; yet it wil not follow, that they did eate his naturall bodie &amp;c. As for <hi>AmbroÅ¿e,</hi> it is true he Å¿o Å¿peakes: but hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundes himÅ¿elfe in that Å¿ame chapter, while as he Å¿ayes, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the bleÅ¿sing another forme or thing is named, but after the conÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration the bodie of ChriÅ¿t is Å¿ignified:</hi> If the bread then Å¿ignifie the bodie of ChriÅ¿t, it is not changed in his body. And becauÅ¿e of this holy vÅ¿e to Å¿ignify the body of ChriÅ¿t, <hi>AmbroÅ¿e</hi> Å¿ayes that <hi>the nature is changed by bleÅ¿sing:</hi> and that this is his meaning his words following will declare it, where he Å¿ayes. <hi>Shall not the words of ChriÅ¿t be of force to change the forme of the Elements.</hi>

And yet with the health of the bodie, the healing of the Å¿oule was oftentimes ioyned, as our Sauiour Å¿ayes to the Paralytick man:

                     <p>As for the 7 point of your doctrine concerning the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ition of hands in the ordination of the lawful miniÅ¿ters of the Kirk of ChriÅ¿t, becauÅ¿e it is a ceremony whilk hes the foundation of it in the worde of God, and was practiÅ¿ed in the primitiue Kirk, as in the ordination of <hi>Timothie</hi> here, and others: and is profitable both to put the PaÅ¿tors in minde of his calling, that he is Å¿eparated of God for the diÅ¿charge of the Å¿ame, and alÅ¿o the people that they imbrace him as one Å¿ent of God to them, therefore we both acknowledge it and practiÅ¿e it. But that either the gift of the holy GhoÅ¿t is inÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably ioyned with it, or that it is a Å¿acrament of the newe TeÅ¿tament properly (as you affirme) that we denie. As to the firÅ¿t, the gift of the holye GhoÅ¿t is not inÅ¿eparablie ioyned with it, firÅ¿t, becauÅ¿e that is iniurious to the Lords free grace, whilk is not bound to any inÅ¿trument, let be to a ceremonie. And alÅ¿o he Å¿peakes againÅ¿t experience: for how many, I pray you, doe receiue impoÅ¿ition of hands, who receiues not a new grace and gift of the holy GhoÅ¿t amongÅ¿t you? MiÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable experience theÅ¿e many ages both doth teÅ¿tifie it,
<note place="margin">Ex veteri TeÅ¿ta. queÅ¿t 109. inter opera AuguÅ¿tini.</note> and alÅ¿o one hes teÅ¿tified the Å¿ame, Å¿aying, <hi>our PreiÅ¿ts doth lay the word of bleÅ¿Å¿ing vppon many, but in fewe followeth the effect of that bleÅ¿Å¿ing.</hi> And certainly if any gift of the holy GhoÅ¿t is ioyned with this ceremonie, it Å¿hould be an abilitie to preach the word: for that is the principall part of the office of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ter of the GoÅ¿pel. But how many thouÅ¿ands are they among you in your Kirk wholes receiued this impoÅ¿ition of hands, and yet as vnable to preach the GoÅ¿pel as AÅ¿Å¿es are? and laÅ¿t of all, what needed that <hi>tryall and examination,</hi> Å¿o Å¿traightlie commanded in the Scripture, whilk ought to be had of them that are to be ordained, if the holy GhoÅ¿t were euer inÅ¿epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rablie
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:20312:79"/> giuen with the ceremonie. For wherefore is this triall and examination? And wherefore is <hi>Timothie</hi> Å¿o Å¿traightlie charged to <hi>lay his hands Å¿uddenlie on no man,</hi> but becauÅ¿e it is onlie the holy GhoÅ¿t who enables. The whilk alÅ¿o Å¿hould be well knowne vnto his Kirk ere they preÅ¿ume to teÅ¿tifie the calling of God to them. For if it were true that ye Å¿ay that the gift of the holy GhoÅ¿t were ioyned with the impoÅ¿ition of hands inÅ¿eparablie,
<note place="margin">1. Timoth. 5.22</note> then the ApoÅ¿tle Å¿hould rather haue commanded <hi>Timothie</hi> to lay his hands vpon manie in reÅ¿pect of the neede that the Kirk Å¿toode in of all men, rather then to haue diÅ¿charged him. And as for the place of <hi>Paule</hi> whilk ye cite here, <hi>DeÅ¿piÅ¿e not the gift &amp;c.</hi> This Å¿erues nothing for your doctrine: for if firÅ¿t the gift giuen to <hi>Timothie</hi> whilk the ApoÅ¿tles Å¿peake of, was extraordinarie, and Å¿o ordinarilie doth not euer follow the ceremonie. 2. It is not aÅ¿criued heere to the ceremonie of impoÅ¿ition of handes, but vnto Prophecy, <hi>whilk is giuen thee by Prophecie,</hi> wherby it was reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the Kirk of the abilitie of this man. And Å¿o if there be anie prophecies that goes of you in your Clergie that the holie GhoÅ¿t is giuen to you, then ye may claime vnto the Å¿ame: but I think ye will not Å¿ay that Å¿ik like prophecies go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of you: therefore yee cannot claime to this teÅ¿timonie. 3.
<note place="margin">2. Tim. 1.14</note> 
                        <hi>Timothie</hi> is exhorted <hi>to keepe that worthie thing concredited vnto him through the holie GhoÅ¿t.</hi> It was the holie GhoÅ¿t therefore who was the giuer and preÅ¿eruer of it. And as for the ceremonie it was a Å¿igne of the preÅ¿ence of gods Å¿pirit in them who was lawfully ordained. Now as to the Å¿econd that ye will haue it a Å¿acrament, becauÅ¿e it hes a externall forme, and alÅ¿o a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿e of grace. That will not follow: for then you Å¿hould haue innumerable Sacraments: for prayer, almouÅ¿-deeds, and the ordination of MagiÅ¿trates, and manye other hes external formes, and hes promiÅ¿es of grace ioyned with them: and yet you will not Å¿ay, that they are properlie Sacraments. For in all the Sacraments of the new TeÅ¿tament whilk properly are Sacraments, there muÅ¿t bee firÅ¿te not onlye an externall action but an earthlie and viÅ¿ible Element, as water in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiÅ¿me, and breade and wyne in the Supper.

                        <hi>and then it is a Å¿acrament.</hi> Secondly, they muÅ¿t haue their expres warrant and inÅ¿titution from IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t in the Scripture, as baptiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me hes <hi>Math.</hi> 28. and the Lords Å¿upper hes <hi>Math.</hi> 26. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they muÅ¿t not only haue a promiÅ¿e of grace, but a promiÅ¿e of remiÅ¿sion of Å¿innes and Å¿anctification: for they muÅ¿t bee Å¿eales of that couenant whilke is common to all ChriÅ¿tians, as baptiÅ¿me and the Lords Å¿upper is. But this ceremonie of impoÅ¿ition of hands wants all theÅ¿e three: for neither is there any earthly element, neither Å¿eales it vp the couenant whilk is common to al, but proper to the miniÅ¿trie only: neither hes it the expres inÅ¿titution of ChriÅ¿t in al the foure EuangeliÅ¿ts. and whereas in the 20. of <hi>Iohn</hi> he there ordaines his ApoÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, we read, he <hi>breathed on them,</hi> and Å¿aid, <hi>receiue the holy GhoÅ¿t.</hi> but not a word that he laid his hands on them, or comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to vÅ¿e it to others.

But this were dangerous to you to Å¿owe abroad: for you feare it woulde caÅ¿t your doctrine in Å¿ome Å¿uÅ¿pition with them, and be an occaÅ¿ion to them, to examine it by the Scripture, the whilk if they would once begin to doe, ye knowe your hope were loÅ¿t. As for <hi>Caluine</hi> &amp; <hi>Melanchton,</hi> they cal it a Å¿acrament taking the worde in an ample Å¿enÅ¿e, for theÅ¿e ceremonies that hes the foundation in the word: whilk hes a promiÅ¿e of a bleÅ¿Å¿ing ioyned with them: and not in that Å¿enÅ¿e that bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiÅ¿me and the Lords Å¿upper are called Å¿acraments, as <hi>Caluine</hi> in that firÅ¿t place whilk ye quote plainly acknowledges: for theÅ¿e are his wordes, <hi>Let the ChriÅ¿tian Kirk (Å¿ayes he) be content of theÅ¿e, (meaning of baptiÅ¿me and the Å¿upper) and let them not admit nor acknowledge, deÅ¿ire, or look for, any other third Å¿acrament til the end of the world.

For if Marriage be not a Sacrament, then the bonde may be lowÅ¿ed by their owne doctrine. But marriage is not a Sacrament, as Å¿hall be proued heereafter: Therefore the bonde is Å¿oluble. Our doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine is, that the bonde of marriage contracted and perfited betweene two ChriÅ¿tians, is broken by the adulterie of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the parties: Å¿o that the innocent diuorced, maye law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully marry another. As for our doctrine. It is plaine in the Scripture, in the 19. and 5. of <hi>Matthew:</hi> where there the Lord in plaine tearmes excepts the cauÅ¿e of fornication, Å¿aying: <hi>WhoÅ¿oeuer dimits his wife except it be for fornication, and marries an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, commits adulterie.</hi> So then by the contrarie: hee that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits his wife for fornicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> (whilk is adulterie there) &amp; mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries another, commits not adulterie. And Å¿eeing the ApoÅ¿tle commands,
<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7.2.</note> 
                        <hi>That euerie man haue his owne wife, and euerie wife her owne husband, and that for the auoyding of fornication: and it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to marrie nor to burne.</hi> Therfore, the firÅ¿t marriage being diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿olued by diuorcement iuÅ¿tly, according to gods worde; It is leaÅ¿ome to the partie innocent at leaÅ¿t, to vÅ¿e the remedie of marriage for the auoyding of fornication.

                     <p>Now, as to the Scriptures whilk ye quote, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.6. and 5.31. they haue that exception of <hi>fornication</hi> expreÅ¿lie mentioned.

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:20312:81"/> all to be vnderÅ¿tood with that exception of <hi>fornication,</hi> that our Sauiour expreÅ¿lie Å¿ets downe in the former two places, otherwaies Scripture Å¿hould be contrary to Scripture, whilk is blaÅ¿phemie to thinke, and our Sauiour is the beÅ¿t exponer of himÅ¿elfe.

But marke (ChriÅ¿tian reader) their ground of this their doctrine. They Å¿ay, the bond of marriage amongÅ¿t infidels may be broken: but Å¿ay they the bond of marriage amongÅ¿t the faithfull cannot be broken. And they make the cauÅ¿e of this difference to be this, becauÅ¿e the marriage of ChriÅ¿tians is a Sacrament. So they reaÅ¿on. Marriage amongÅ¿t ChriÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans is a Sacrament: therefore Å¿ay they, it cannot be broken. But what is their principal ground now, wherby they proue marriage to be a Sacrament? becauÅ¿e (Å¿ay they) the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of ChriÅ¿tians is a bond indiÅ¿Å¿oluble; therefore it is a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament whilk hes the grace of IuÅ¿tification ioyned with it. So mutuallie, one error vpholds another. Vpon the whilk I reaÅ¿on: If the bond of marriage may be broken for adultery then it cannot be a Sacrament: (this your Kirk graunts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e they make that the ground of this) but the bonde of marriage may be broken for adulterie, as hath bene proued before, both by the Scriptures, &amp; alÅ¿o by your owne canons, councels, Doctors, and Popes: therefore marriage is not a Sacrament.</p>

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:20312:82"/> are earthlie elements: as the water in BaptiÅ¿me: the bread and wine in the Å¿upper: and an expreÅ¿Å¿e forme of words pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿criued in the newe TeÅ¿tament: as in BaptiÅ¿me, <hi>I bapitze thee, &amp;c.</hi> and in the Supper, <hi>This is my bodie &amp;c. Matth.</hi> 26. They haue their expreÅ¿Å¿e inÅ¿titution by ChriÅ¿t in the Å¿ame, and hes the promiÅ¿es of remiÅ¿sion of Å¿innes and iuÅ¿tification annexed to them. But none of theÅ¿e things are to be had in marriage. FirÅ¿t, no earthlie element: next, no forme preÅ¿criued in the word of God: thirdlie, no expreÅ¿Å¿e inÅ¿titution of it as of a Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament: fourthlie, no promiÅ¿e of the remiÅ¿sion of Å¿innes and Å¿aluation annexed vnto it. Therefore it cannot be a Å¿acra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the new TeÅ¿tament properlie.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, if marriage were a Å¿acrament, and Å¿ik a Å¿acrament that Å¿ignified and gaue the grace of iuÅ¿tification with it,
<note place="margin">Bellarm. lib. 1, de matrim, cap. 5 pag. 67</note> that is, remiÅ¿sion of Å¿innes: then wherefore Å¿hould your Kirk for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid all your Cleargie from the Å¿ame? and wherefore Å¿houlde ye abÅ¿taine from that Å¿acrament, whilk is inÅ¿tituted of God, to giue remiÅ¿sion of Å¿innes to you, and to make you accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God, as your doctrine Å¿ayes. Why Å¿houlde yee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue your Å¿elf of that thing whilk may place you in Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uour, and purchaÅ¿e to you remiÅ¿sion of Å¿innes, (as ye Å¿ay ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage may doe) it is a token that either ye beleeue not your owne doctrine, or elÅ¿e preferres whoredome and adulterie, whilk is condemned of God, to marriage whilk is Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance and honorable amongÅ¿t all men.</p>
                     <p>Fourthlie, I Å¿ay, if the marriage of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eua</hi> in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiÅ¿e, and the marriage of all the Patriarckes, &amp; Prophets, and PrieÅ¿ts, and people in the olde TeÅ¿tament, was not a Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, neither is the marriage of ChriÅ¿tians in the new te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tament a Å¿acrament. For they were Å¿ymboles that repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ented our Å¿pirituall coniunction with ChriÅ¿t, aÅ¿well as the marriage of ChriÅ¿tians in the new teÅ¿tament does: the whilk you will not deny.

The workes muÅ¿t not be debt, that is, Å¿ik workes as we are bound before to doe; for the paying of that duty whilk we owe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie cannot merite properly a rewarde: for will you Å¿ay that for the paying of that whilk you owe alreadie you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erue a reward? 3. There muÅ¿t be a proportion and equality betweene the worke wrought and the rewarde it Å¿elfe, for if the worke be leÅ¿Å¿e and the reward greater, then that whilk is more then the work is not of merite but of liberalitie. 4. The perÅ¿ons to whome the worke is done muÅ¿t be obliÅ¿hed and bound by right to rander and recompence the worker for the worthines of the worke, Å¿o that he is not iuÅ¿t and he do it not. And laÅ¿t of all the worke muÅ¿t be our owne and not an others, and the power our owne whereby it is done and not an others, or we can be Å¿aide properly to merite by the Å¿ame. But all theÅ¿e conditions will faile in our workes: therefore they cannot bee meritorious of eternall life. For as to the

As for the places of the <hi>PÅ¿almes</hi> whilk ye quote heir, <hi>Peter</hi> brings them not in to proue this locall deÅ¿cenÅ¿ion (as ye Å¿ay) whereof he makes no mention: but to proue his reÅ¿urrection as he Å¿ayes in the 31. verÅ¿e moÅ¿t plainly: <hi>He know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this before,</hi> Å¿peaking of <hi>Dauid, Å¿pake of the reÅ¿urrection of ChriÅ¿t, that his Å¿oule Å¿hould not remaine in graue, neither his fleÅ¿he Å¿houlde Å¿ee corruption.</hi> So, if ye will beleeue the Å¿pirite of God in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿tle interpreting theÅ¿e places, they Å¿peake of the reÅ¿urre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ChriÅ¿t, and not of the deliuering of the Å¿oule out of hell, for he was in ParadiÅ¿e, as he Å¿ayes himÅ¿elfe: and it is the bodie that was raiÅ¿ed, and not the Å¿oule. And the Hebrewe word is NEPHESCH, whilk not onely Å¿ignifieth the Å¿oule, but alÅ¿o the life, as <hi>Gen</hi> 37.21. <hi>Let vs Å¿mite his Å¿oule,</hi> that is, take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his life. And it Å¿ignifieth alÅ¿o the body of the dead wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there was life, as <hi>Leuit.</hi> 21. ver. 1. and 11. And this worde hel is SCHEOL in Hebrew, whilk moÅ¿t vÅ¿uallie is taken in the Scripture for the graue. So then the meaning is this, <hi>The Lord will not leaue his</hi> NepheÅ¿ch, that is, the bodie wherein his life was in <hi>Scheol,</hi> that is, in the graue: whilk Å¿peach is vÅ¿ual in the Scripture. Now as to the other PÅ¿alme 29.3. it is Å¿poken pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlie of <hi>Dauid,</hi> where hee thankes God who had Å¿aued his life from the handes of his enemies, whilk by a borrowed Å¿peach frequented in the Scripture, is called the deliuery of his Å¿oule from the graue. As for the 4. of the <hi>EpheÅ¿ians,</hi> TheÅ¿e <hi>lower parts of the earth</hi> is not hell, as ye expone it, but the earth it Å¿elf, whilk in reÅ¿pect of the world is the loweÅ¿t part: and Å¿o
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:20312:91"/> it is taken in the 139. <hi>PÅ¿alme,</hi> ver. 15. where <hi>Dauid</hi> Å¿ayes, <hi>Thou hes faÅ¿hioned me beneath in the lower parts of the earth,</hi> where heir it is not taken for hell, as you take it in that place of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheÅ¿ians,</hi> otherwiÅ¿e you muÅ¿t Å¿ay that <hi>Dauid</hi> vvas borne in hell vvhilk I trovv ye vvill not Å¿ay.

                     <p>As for the 2. of <hi>Iames</hi> whilk ye quote here, that <hi>by works a man is iuÅ¿tified and not by Å¿aith only.</hi> I anÅ¿were. This word <hi>to be iuÅ¿tified,</hi> is taken in the Scripture two manner of wayes. FirÅ¿t, to be accompted righteous before the tribunal of God: and in this Å¿enÅ¿e, only a liuely faith apprehending the death and righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e of ChriÅ¿t iuÅ¿tifies vs: and of this is the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerÅ¿ie. Next, it is taken for a declaration of ones righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, as in the 3. of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> ver. 4. <hi>That thou may be iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tified in thy words</hi> (that is, declared to be iuÅ¿t) <hi>when thou iudges.</hi> And in this Å¿enÅ¿e it is taken in this place. So that this is the meaning of it. Ye Å¿ee then, <hi>by works man is iuÅ¿tified,</hi> that is, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by his works to be iuÅ¿t, and <hi>not by faith onlie,</hi> that is, by the profeÅ¿sion of his faith in ChriÅ¿t. So then <hi>Iames</hi> Å¿peakes not of our IuÅ¿tification before God whilk is by faith only, but of the declaration of our righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e before men, whilk he calles IuÅ¿tification: and that for theÅ¿e reaÅ¿ons. 1. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e <hi>Iames</hi> Å¿hould be contrary to <hi>Paule</hi> who Å¿ayes, <hi>That a man is iuÅ¿tified by faith without workes,</hi> whilk is blaÅ¿phemous to think therefore <hi>Iames</hi> Å¿peakes of our IuÅ¿tification before men, wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>by our IuÅ¿tification before God is declared and made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿t. 2. The Å¿cope of the whole chapter, and whole EpiÅ¿tle te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tifies the Å¿ame. For his purpoÅ¿e is to caÅ¿t downe the arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancie and preÅ¿umption of Å¿ik, who bragged of their Faith, as though the bare profeÅ¿sion, that they beleeued in ChriÅ¿t, were Å¿ufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t to Å¿aue them, Å¿uppoÅ¿e they did not bring forth the fruites thereof. Therefore the ApoÅ¿tle takes this in hand to prooue that they are not iuÅ¿tified by a dead faith, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie by that faith whilk brings forth the effects thereof. And therefore he Å¿ayes in the fourteenth verÅ¿e, <hi>What auayleth it my brethren when a man Å¿ayes he hes faith, when he hes no workes?
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:20312:95"/> can that faith Å¿aue him?</hi> And in the eighteenth verÅ¿e, <hi>Shewe mee thy faith out of thy workes, and I will Å¿hewe thee my faith by my workes.</hi> And becauÅ¿e it may be ye Å¿ay, this is my commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, therefore heare howe one of your owne great and chiefe pillers <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquine</hi> expones the Å¿ame, from whoÅ¿e iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I hope, ye will not appeale.

For they Å¿peake onlie of the neceÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of good workes, whilk as they cannot be Å¿eparate from true faith, Å¿o no man can attaine to Å¿aluation without them: becauÅ¿e where euer ChriÅ¿t dwelles by true Faith, not onelie he iuÅ¿tifies them, but alÅ¿o Å¿anctifie them, and makes them fruitfull in good works. The whilk we graunt, and therfore does vrge the Å¿ame continuallie, knowing for a trueth,
<note place="margin">Heb. 12 14 Matth. 3.10</note> that <hi>without holineÅ¿Å¿e no man Å¿hall Å¿ee God, and that the axe is laide to the roote of the tree, and that euery tree that bringeth not forth good fruite Å¿halbe hewen downe, and caÅ¿t in an vnquencheable fire.</hi> They Å¿peake

<note place="margin">That is a deade faith whilk brought not forth good works.</note> for theÅ¿e are his words: <hi>that Å¿ome thought that faith onely was Å¿ufficient to obtaine Å¿aluation without workes, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecting to liue well, and to holde the way of God by good works, and being Å¿ecure of Å¿aluation, whilk is in faith, had not a care to liue well,</hi> as he Å¿ayes. And in the end of that chapter he concludes the whole matter Å¿aying, <hi>How farre therefore are they deceiued, who promiÅ¿es to themÅ¿elues euerlaÅ¿ting life throgh a dead faith.</hi> The whilk error we condemne alÅ¿o with you: for we acknowledge the neceÅ¿sitie of good works, as the fruites of a liuing faith: but not as the efficient, formal, or inÅ¿trumentall cauÅ¿e of our iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tification.</p>

It is no wonder Å¿uppoÅ¿e you diÅ¿Å¿ent from your brethren (as I haue proued in Å¿undrie points before) Å¿eing ye diÅ¿Å¿ent from your Å¿elfe.

But what a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictorious Å¿pirit is this of yours, who to gaineÅ¿ay the thing that I write, cares not to inuolue your Å¿elfe in a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not only to the trueth, but alÅ¿o to your own Catholicks. Either therefore wonder at your owne Catholickes, who hes Å¿poken as much and more in this poynt nor I did, and at your Å¿elf alÅ¿o, who grants as much in Å¿ubÅ¿tance as I mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that ye and they haue abuÅ¿ed the Scripture, or els leaue of to wonder at me, and wonder at the vaile whilk is hung ouer your owne eies, whilk hinders you not only to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tand the trueth, but alÅ¿o to vnderÅ¿tand what your Å¿elfe and your owne bretheren teaches. Now as for your reaÅ¿on, it is not Å¿aid that Babylo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> was in the deÅ¿ert, but <hi>that Iohn was taken in the Å¿pirit,</hi> that is, rauiÅ¿hed in the Å¿pirit (as in the 1. and 4. chapter) <hi>into the deÅ¿ert</hi> that is, into a Å¿olitare and heauenlie contemplation of that viÅ¿ion whilk was afterward Å¿howne him. For as this carrying of him in the Å¿pirit Å¿ignifies his Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall rauiÅ¿hing, Å¿o this <hi>deÅ¿ert</hi> Å¿ignifies the Å¿olitarenes of his contemplation. And as <hi>that lifting vp of Ezechiell by the lockes of the haire of his head betwene the heauen and the earth, &amp; that carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him to the door of the innermoÅ¿t port towards the North, to Å¿ee the abominations of IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> was only in viÅ¿ion, &amp; not bodily.

As for the expoÅ¿ition of your trew Catholickes, we count not much of them. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies theÅ¿e whome ye call your trew Catholicks, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> the RhemiÅ¿ts, and <hi>Sanderus</hi> hes bene plaine in this matter, and hes Å¿poken more in this poynt then we doe. And as for the time of this her Å¿ecrecie and lurking 1260. daies whilk you expound literallie to be but three yeares and a halfe. I anÅ¿wer, this expoÅ¿itio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of yours is againÅ¿t firÅ¿t the cuÅ¿tome of propheÅ¿ies, whilk are expounded figuratiuelie and not lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, as theÅ¿e 70. weekes in <hi>Daniel</hi> concerning ChriÅ¿t, where there a daye is put for a yeare. Next, it is againÅ¿t the whole circumÅ¿tances of ihe text: for will you expound this <hi>woman</hi> figuratiuely for the Kirk, as <hi>Sanderus</hi> does: and the <hi>wildernes</hi> vnto the whilk Å¿he fled, figuratiuely for the Å¿mall number wherunto Å¿he Å¿halbe redacted, as you doe: &amp; the <hi>Å¿un where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Å¿he was cled, and the moone whilk was vnder her feete, and the twelue Å¿tarres that was vpon her head, and the red Dragon whilk per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ewed her with ten heads &amp;c.</hi> all figuratiuelie, and yet will yee expound the time of her being in the wilderneÅ¿Å¿e literallie? What violence is this whilk yee will offer vnto the holye trueth of God, to expound all the reÅ¿t figuratiuely, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the time literallie? So then a day here is Å¿et for a yeare, as alÅ¿o it is taken in the Å¿ame Å¿enÅ¿e in the 2. chapter of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation</hi> in the EpiÅ¿tle to Smyrna, where it is Å¿aid <hi>they Å¿hal haue tribulation for the Å¿pace of ten dayes:</hi> that is, for the Å¿pace of ten yeares. As for the inviÅ¿ibility of our Kirk, becauÅ¿e that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tion cums afterward, therefore I omit it now. Only this, as your Hierarchie and abhomination of your Kirk grew, Å¿o did the puritie of the doctrine of IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t in his Kirk de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay.

MarchiÅ¿toun Å¿ayes, that to be cled in Å¿ackcloth, is to preach the word of God with the obÅ¿curitie of mens traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and coloured gloÅ¿Å¿es. MaiÅ¿ter Iohn Å¿ayes heir, that the Å¿ackcloth Å¿igni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies perÅ¿ecution for the preaching of the worde. The notes on their Geneua Bibles printed at London, expones the Å¿ackcloth to Å¿ignifie poore &amp; Å¿imple apparell. And Bale vpon the Å¿ame place writes, that this Å¿ackcloth Å¿ignifies Å¿ober conuerÅ¿ation.

If the AntichriÅ¿t and his members Å¿hall Å¿lay them, how can they doe the Å¿ame, except they know and may Å¿ee them? To be inviÅ¿ible, is not to be knowne or Å¿eene: but they will Å¿ee and know them, or elÅ¿e they cannot diÅ¿cerne them from their owne, wherby they may put them to death, and Å¿aue their owne. The Å¿econd thing to be noted, that our MiniÅ¿ters in Scotland except they be put to death by the Pope, they beare not the teÅ¿timonie of ChriÅ¿t. For theÅ¿e are MaiÅ¿ter Iohns owne words. And S.

So is Å¿he not literallie the place where ChriÅ¿t was crucified, but only myÅ¿ticallie and Å¿pirituallie for the likenes betwene them: that as by the authoritie of the Emperour of Rome, his deputie Pilate our Lord was crucified, for the falÅ¿e chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge of treaÅ¿on againÅ¿t the Emperour, whilk was falÅ¿ly and wickedlie laide to his charge: and therefore is Å¿aide heir by the holy ghoÅ¿t, to be crucified at Rome: that is, by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the rulers at Rome: So by the authority of the Popes who now reignes &amp; hes reigned theÅ¿e many yeares at Rome, ChriÅ¿t is crucified againe in his members, becauÅ¿e they will not receaue his marke, and worÅ¿hip him. And as IeruÅ¿alem boaÅ¿ted her Å¿elf to be a holie cietie, and the Å¿pouÅ¿e of ChriÅ¿t, and yet was a harlote, a murtherer,

And if ye will aske, When did the bodies of the Saints lye in the Å¿treetes of Rome? I anÅ¿were: As by the <hi>gates in the cietie</hi> in the fourt command, is not meant the gates of the cietie properlie, but the authoritie and iuriÅ¿diction of the cietie: Å¿o by the Å¿treetes of Rome is not onely meant the gates within the walles of Rome, but all the places and parts whither his power and dominion hes Å¿pred the Å¿elfe. So that all the places where the Popes of Rome hes exerciÅ¿ed their tyrannie ouer the Saints, are called heir the Å¿treetes of that great Cietie.

                     </p>
                     <p>Let vs Å¿ee the force of this argument that ye make for your Pope, that he is not the AntichriÅ¿t. The woman, ye Å¿ay, that fled to the wilderneÅ¿Å¿e, is the true Kirk: that I graunt: &amp; to fly into the wilderneÅ¿Å¿e is to be inuiÅ¿ible by me. I anÅ¿were: By me it is to be latent, and to lurke, to eÅ¿chew the rage of her perÅ¿ecuters, and not to be openlie conuerÅ¿ant, as that all the worlde may knowe her: and yet not to be Å¿o latent, but that Å¿ome of them are knowne both amongÅ¿t themÅ¿elues, as alÅ¿o to their enemies. And this is our meaning (as I haue Å¿aid before) vvhen vve affirme that the particular Kirks Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times becomes inviÅ¿ible. But you take it as though our mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning were that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kirk is Å¿o inuiÅ¿ible, that it is known to none whilk is your inuention, MaiÅ¿ter <hi>Gilbert,</hi> and not our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: and therefore you fight without an aduerÅ¿arie in this point. But to goe forward to the reÅ¿t of your argument: you Å¿ay, that by me there was Å¿undrie that oppugned the Pope, and his Cleargie, and was put to death by them, This is true: and therefore <hi>the blood of the Saints is found</hi> in your Kirk. Now what will you gather of all this? Therefore Å¿ay you the Pope is not the AntichriÅ¿t, becauÅ¿e he perÅ¿ecuts but viÅ¿ible things, or elÅ¿e, the Kirk is not inuiÅ¿ible. I deny that either the one or the other will follow. And becauÅ¿e you made an argument againÅ¿t your Pope (I Å¿hould haue Å¿aid with him) that he is not the AntichriÅ¿t, whilk is grounded vpon your owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention, miÅ¿taking our doctrine, and therefore hes no feete: I will make another for him that he is the AntichriÅ¿t, the whilk you nor all your Cleargie will not be able to diÅ¿proue. He is that vndoubted AntichriÅ¿t, whilk hes redacted the kirk of ChriÅ¿t, as it were in a wilderneÅ¿Å¿e, to a Å¿mal handfull: part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through the peÅ¿t of his damnable doctrine, partly throgh his extreame perÅ¿ecution, Å¿o that they were compelled to lurke and hyde themÅ¿elues from the crueltie of his power. This you cannot deny, becauÅ¿e the Scripture affirmes this of the AntichriÅ¿t. But I aÅ¿Å¿ume, that the Popes of Rome hes done this theÅ¿e many hundreth yeares, as I haue proued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and in the other part of my anÅ¿were: therfore of neceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿itie
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:20312:114"/> it muÅ¿t followe, that the Popes of Rome are the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriÅ¿t that the Scripture foretold Å¿hould come. AnÅ¿were this if you can.</p>
                     <p>And as for the time of this inuiÅ¿ibilitie, it hes relation to the beginning, and grouth, and hight of your AntichriÅ¿tian kingdome: for as it grewe the Kirk was more and more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cured: and when it was at the hight, the Kirk was in her E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipÅ¿e: and as it hes decaied now Å¿ince, Å¿he hes accordinglie Å¿pred her Å¿elf abroade. If the ApoÅ¿tle be true that <hi>myÅ¿terie of iniquitie began to worke in his dayes:</hi>

                     <p>You Å¿ay next that you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tend not whether ye haue Å¿poken againÅ¿t the Pope or not, for al heretickes hes euer barked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t him, and that Å¿ore againÅ¿t your hart, (MaiÅ¿ter <hi>Gilbert</hi>) becauÅ¿e you cannot deny but yee haue taught this doctrine with vs: and if it bee Å¿o (MaiÅ¿ter <hi>Gilbert</hi>) that theÅ¿e men and Kirks and many thouÅ¿and more of all Å¿ortes hes taught this doctrine with vs manye hundreth yeares before <hi>Martine Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> for the firÅ¿t two whilk I named was almoÅ¿te 400. yeare before him: then why were you Å¿o Å¿hameles both to write it &amp; alÅ¿o Å¿peake it, to blinde your poore countriemen to their and yours damnation that our religion was begun by <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Luther,</hi> &amp; neuer profeÅ¿Å¿ed before him. So leaue off (Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ter <hi>Gilbert</hi>) to beguile the Å¿imple and ignorant people with this Å¿ottiÅ¿h and blaÅ¿phemous reaÅ¿on of yours, (<hi>Martine Luther</hi> is the author of our religion) for nowe you are inforced to graunt the contrarie that infinite nombers hes taught the Å¿ame doctrine before him. The truth is too Å¿trong for you (MaiÅ¿ter <hi>Gilbert</hi>) that compels you to graunt the thing that ye woulde wiÅ¿h with all your hart the people neuer knew it: but comfort your Å¿elfe (MaiÅ¿ter <hi>Gilbert</hi>) for the trueth will be victorious at the laÅ¿t, and your darknes daily more and more will be diÅ¿couered. Indeede the leaÅ¿t Å¿troke that ye can giue for the defence of your Pope is to call them all heretickes who hes Å¿poken againÅ¿t him, for I graunt the Pope and his Clergie is not Å¿ik fooles, as being their owne Iudges to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:20312:118"/> them Å¿elues, and to iuÅ¿tifie them, who not onely hes taught it, but alÅ¿o Å¿ufficiently did prooue it, and many thouÅ¿ands Å¿ealed with their blood that he was the AntichriÅ¿t, &amp; his Kirk <hi>Babell.</hi> But with them, they haue the <hi>Å¿onne of God, &amp; the ApoÅ¿tles, Paule and Iohn</hi> heretickes: for they alÅ¿o did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne his Idolatry, and tyrannie, and errors. But where a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout now will ye contend (MaiÅ¿ter <hi>Gilbert?</hi>) ye Å¿ay whether their doctrine be hereÅ¿ie or not? I would you and your Kirk would Å¿tand vpon this, and giue ouer all your other conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions whill this were firÅ¿t prooued, whether their doctrine in Å¿o far as they aggree with ours: &amp; ours, in Å¿o far as it diÅ¿Å¿ents from yours, be hereÅ¿ie or not, that is, be againÅ¿t the Å¿cripture or not, the whilk if you would doe, then I hope our conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would Å¿oone be ended. But for as faÅ¿t as you runne to this now, you will flee from it as faÅ¿t againe, when we deÅ¿ire to haue yours &amp; our doctrine, tried by the Scriptures whilk of them is hereÅ¿ie: and conÅ¿equently, whether ye or we be heretickes? And therefore you euer refuÅ¿e to let your doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine be tried by the Å¿cripture, but runnes to your prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ded antiquitie, and Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ions, Councels, and lying miracles, &amp; many other vaine Å¿tarting holes, like a vvilde Fox, when he is hunted out of one hole he flies to another, and dare neuer abyde the faire fields. And marke their craft, reader, vvhen vve affirme that our religion hes IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t to bee the author of it in the Scriptures, as vve offer to proue the Å¿ame, yee refuÅ¿e this triall by the Scriptures, and Å¿ayes that <hi>Martine Luther</hi> inuented our religion, and vve had none that profeÅ¿Å¿ed it, and taught it before him. When vve againe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that vvee had Å¿undry of all Å¿ortes manie hundred yeares before him, euen vvhen your Kingdome vvas at the hight, and produces their names, they not beeing able to deny it, they Å¿lyp from that againe, and Å¿aies they contend not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there was Å¿ik that taught Å¿ik doctrine or not: but they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tend whether that was trueth or hereÅ¿ie: Å¿o they run from one Å¿tarting hole to another. But I will ask you (MaiÅ¿ter <hi>Gilbert</hi>) if it be proued that this their doctrine was not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ie, wil you contend any more then, Å¿hal the pley ceaÅ¿e then?
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:20312:119"/> will you euer Å¿lander our religion of noueltie in Å¿aying <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Luther</hi> was the firÅ¿t that began it, and vvee had none who profeÅ¿Å¿ed before him: but you will Å¿ay, this you haue not proued? It is true I had not proued it then; but now I hope I haue proued it Å¿ufficiently that your Popes are the AntichriÅ¿t, &amp; your Rome <hi>Babell,</hi> whilk was one of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal heads of the doctrine whilk yee taught, and Å¿undrie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers alÅ¿o.

And therefore this that MaiÅ¿ter Iohn calles the only trueth, was neuer profeÅ¿Å¿ed in all heades, as it is now in Scotland, before in no countrie, no not by any one man, let be by a nomber, whilke thing MaiÅ¿ter <hi>Robert BruÅ¿e</hi> graunts himÅ¿elf in his Å¿ermons, in theÅ¿e words: And God hes choÅ¿en a few hearts in this countrie, where he hes begun his dwelling place, for God dwelles now in the harts and conÅ¿ciences of his own by his holy Spirit.

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:20312:120"/> is not of your religion. And ye your Å¿elf if ye be meaÅ¿ured by this meaÅ¿ure, is not a right PapiÅ¿t, becauÅ¿e you diÅ¿Å¿ent from many of them in many things as hes beene prooued before. And certainlie, MaiÅ¿ter <hi>Gilbert,</hi> if this reaÅ¿on of yours holde forth, you Å¿hall cut off from your profeÅ¿sion Å¿ik a nomber of Popes, Councels, IeÅ¿uites, Cardinals, &amp; Doctors fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, that it is to be feared, that they cut you off from being a right defender of their Catholick faith, yea from beeing a member of their Å¿ynagogue, that for the defence thereof is compelled to cut off Å¿o many from the Å¿ame. And Å¿econdly, I Å¿ay, your reports concerning their doctrine, is not to be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited, but their owne apologies and writings, whereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares that it hes bene alwaies your faÅ¿hion, the more to diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credite them, to charge them with a number of abÅ¿urde opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, whilk they neuer held. As for example, you charge heir <hi>Waldus</hi> and his followers to haue had their wiues, and al other things common, whilk is your calumnie of them, and not their practiÅ¿e, or doctrine. For <hi>Gulielmus Parvus</hi> wrytes <hi>that their life was commendable,</hi> &amp; <hi>Reinerus</hi> in his booke of inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿itions, one of your owne religion, a writer of 300. yeares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe, who was often at the examination of them, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf Å¿aies, confeÅ¿Å¿es <hi>that they had great Å¿hew of holy lyfe, and that they beleeued all things well of God, and all the articles contained in the Creed, and liued iuÅ¿tly before men: and charges them that they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and blaÅ¿phemed</hi> Å¿olam Romanam EccleÅ¿iam, <hi>the RomiÅ¿h Kirk only.</hi> So then, if his report be true, as I hope ye will not gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ay, they were both far from that error, for that were neither to beleeue all things well of God, nor yet to haue a Å¿hewe of holy life, and to liue iuÅ¿tly before men: and alÅ¿o they were of our religion in all things.</p>
                     <p>And where you Å¿ay that we renew many old condemned hereÅ¿ies: I anÅ¿wer, that neither the doctrine whilk I affirmed they taught heir was hereÅ¿ies, nor yet themÅ¿elues hereticks. But you and your Kirk who hes condemned them for the trueth of God, and hes renewd olde condemned hereÅ¿ies, as Å¿hall be proued afterward. And we haue renewd no hereÅ¿ie at all, but onely the trueth of God whilk your Kirk hes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cured
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:20312:120"/> and buried. Therefore your concluÅ¿ion is falÅ¿e, that our religion was neuer profeÅ¿Å¿ed in all points as it is now in Scotland before in no countrie, no not, Å¿ay you, by anie one man. For it was taught &amp; profeÅ¿Å¿ed by ChriÅ¿t and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tles, and alÅ¿o by all the primitiue Kirks in their daies, in all points, throughout all the partes of the world, where they preached the GoÅ¿pel, as it is now in Scotland, as we offer to proue by their writtings, and I haue proued the Å¿ame in Å¿un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie heads heir. Next, the Å¿ubÅ¿tance thereof was continued manie hundreth yeares in the Kirks of ChriÅ¿t, whill partlie by the hereÅ¿ies that Å¿prang vp (for the popple was Å¿oone Å¿owne among the good Å¿eede, and the myÅ¿terie of iniquitie began to work in the ApoÅ¿tles daies) and partly by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet, &amp; partly by the darknes of Poperie, it was corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted peece &amp; peece. And what difference can you finde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the religion that the <hi>WaldenÅ¿es</hi> profeÅ¿Å¿ed, and vs; if ye will giue credite to their Apologies, and <hi>Reinerus</hi> teÅ¿timonies of them? As for MaiÅ¿ter <hi>Robert BruÅ¿es</hi> teÅ¿timonye whilk yee produce, it Å¿erues no waies to confirme your purpoÅ¿e: but Å¿eeing ye abuÅ¿e the teÅ¿timonies of Scripture, it is no wonder Å¿uppoÅ¿e yee abuÅ¿e the teÅ¿timonies of men. For it is moÅ¿t true whilk he affirmes that the trueth of God hes continued for that Å¿pace in this kingdome without hereÅ¿ie or Å¿chiÅ¿me, as we neuer read it did in any nation in the earth, in Å¿ik purity without hereÅ¿ie and Å¿chiÅ¿me for Å¿ik a long Å¿pace. And yet it followes not but he hes dwelt in Å¿undrie Kirks in Å¿ik puritie before, Å¿uppoÅ¿e not Å¿o long together, whilk you omit in your concluÅ¿ion. Doth it follow by his teÅ¿timony, but that our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion hes bene preached &amp; profeÅ¿Å¿ed in all true Kirks, in all points, Å¿uppoÅ¿e not Å¿o long in Å¿ik purity, as it is in Scotland? neither doth it followe but that the Å¿ubÅ¿tantiall and maine points of our religion hes beene profeÅ¿Å¿ed in all ChriÅ¿tian Kirks, longer nor that Å¿pace, Å¿uppoÅ¿e mixed either with Å¿om hereÅ¿ies or Å¿chiÅ¿mes. So you muÅ¿t coine a new logick (Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ter <hi>Gilbert</hi>) before ye can confirme your propoÅ¿ition by his teÅ¿timonie.</p>

And <hi>Reinerus</hi> a man of your ovvne religion teÅ¿tifies that Å¿ome Å¿aide <hi>the WaldenÅ¿es who had the Å¿ame religion whilk we proÅ¿es, was continued from SilueÅ¿ters daies, who liued about the</hi> 320. <hi>yeare of God.

I Å¿ee you are not aÅ¿hamed to Å¿peake anie thing for the defence of your Kingdome, vvere it neuer Å¿o manifeÅ¿tlie falÅ¿e: for it appeares that eyther yee are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted vvith the hiÅ¿tories of that age, or elÅ¿e yee diÅ¿Å¿emble it of purpoÅ¿e: for <hi>Iohn WickleÅ¿</hi> he left Å¿o manye behinde him in England vvho profeÅ¿Å¿ed our religion, that though your Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates did moleÅ¿t them vvhat they coulde, yet they &amp; their fauourers in Å¿hort tyme grew to Å¿ik Å¿trength &amp; multitude, that by the yeare 1422.

In England <hi>William Tayler,</hi> was bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>anno</hi> 1422, and two yeares after that <hi>William White</hi> was burnt. And betwixt that time, and 1430.

                     <p>Now are we, by Gods grace, come vnto your laÅ¿t calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, in affirming that wee renew olde condemned hereÅ¿ies. This is indeede (MaiÅ¿ter <hi>Gilbert</hi>) a heauie challenge, if it were true: but it is but like the reÅ¿t of your calumnies: yea, it hes leÅ¿Å¿e appearance of trueth, nor any thing whilk ye haue Å¿poken againÅ¿t vs. <hi>Alyar,</hi> MaiÅ¿ter <hi>Gilbert, Å¿hall not enter in that heauenly cietie,</hi>

                        <hi>but his portion Å¿hall be in that lake that burnes with fire and brimÅ¿tone, and he that Å¿landereth his neighbour (much more then be who Å¿landereth the trueth of God) Å¿hall not reÅ¿t in the Lords holy mountaine.</hi> But to come to the firÅ¿t, <hi>Nouatus</hi> intruded himÅ¿elfe in another mans charge, and cauÅ¿ed Å¿et vp himÅ¿elfe againÅ¿t <hi>Cornelius</hi> the lawfull PaÅ¿tor in the Kirk in Rome then, &amp; that craftilie: and withdrew many of his flock from him, whilk is as contrarie to our doctrine, as black to white. For we teach that euery paÅ¿tor Å¿hould haue his owne particular flock, as <hi>Cornelius</hi> had then in Rome, and no man Å¿hould intrude him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf in another mans charge, as he did. So this is a calumny, MaiÅ¿ter <hi>Gilbert.</hi> But your Popes are like <hi>Nouatus,</hi> who not only hes diÅ¿turbed al the ChriÅ¿tian congregations in Europe almoÅ¿te, by Å¿etting vp and thruÅ¿ting downe Å¿ik PaÅ¿tors as he would, but alÅ¿o all the kingdomes in Europe. As for this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Aerius,</hi> I anÅ¿were you, as ye did me: I contend not whether he taught this doctrine or not, for the Å¿criptures hes taught the Å¿ame. But our contention is, whether they be he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reÅ¿ie or not, whilk you haue not prooued, nor euer will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to proue by the Scripture. It is true <hi>Epiphamus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tine</hi> following him, reckons him amongÅ¿t heretickes, but <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoretus</hi> in his booke <hi>de fabulis Iudaerum,</hi> and the EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿tical hiÅ¿torie reckons him not amongÅ¿t hereticks: and he was not condemned for an heretick in any Councell: that therefore whilk he taught according to the Scripture we imbrace. But as for the errors of the <hi>Acrians,</hi> whilk are errors in deede, and whilk are aÅ¿criued vnto them, <hi>as the damning of marriage, vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of continencie, requyring them whome they receaue to their fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip to forÅ¿ake their owne proper things:</hi> theÅ¿e hereÅ¿ies, I Å¿ay, your Kirk hes renewed, who damnes marriage, and vrges conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:20312:122"/> in your Cleargie, and receaues none to your religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous orders, but Å¿ik as refuÅ¿es their owne proper things. As to the third, the <hi>Aetian</hi> and <hi>Eunomian</hi> hereÅ¿ies, they Å¿ecluded ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineÅ¿Å¿e of life from that faith of theirs, and taught Å¿ik a faith that might Å¿tand with whatÅ¿oeuer Å¿innes, and with perÅ¿eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in them. Will you Å¿tand to this (MaiÅ¿ter <hi>Gilbert</hi>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, that we teach Å¿ik doctrine? Is not this our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that only liuing faith whilk works by loue, &amp; brings forth good fruits doth iuÅ¿tifie? But you are like to them that knowes no other iuÅ¿tifying faith, but Å¿ik a faith, as both the reprobates and the Diuels may haue. So this is your third calumnie.</p>

                     <p>Whether <hi>Valentinus</hi> taught Å¿o or not, I contend not: but the queÅ¿tion is of this doctrine, of the reall preÅ¿ence, whether it be contrare to Gods word, or not; the whilk I haue proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Å¿ufficiently before in the fourth point of doctrine: and Å¿o the denying of it is no hereÅ¿ie. But yet it appeares not by this teÅ¿timonie of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> whilk ye cite heir, that he taught Å¿ik doctrine.</p>
                     <p>As for the 8. hereÅ¿ie, it is a calumnie to aÅ¿criue it to vs, for <hi>Melanchton, Caluine,</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> hes no Å¿ik doctrine. You are not aÅ¿hamed, MaiÅ¿ter <hi>Gilbert,</hi> of impudent lying.</p>
                     <p>As for the 9. of <hi>Nouatus</hi> hereÅ¿ie, that is a calumnie to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿criue it to vs. I or <hi>Nouatus</hi> denied that there was any place of repentance to theÅ¿e, who after they were baptiÅ¿ed, fel from the faith, by ony infirmitie, or violence of perÅ¿ecution, as <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piphanius</hi> teÅ¿tifies of him that hee Å¿aide, <hi>No man who hes falne after BaptiÅ¿me can any more obtaine mercie.</hi> But our doctrine is
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:20312:124"/> contrare to this: for we teach that there is place to repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce for any Å¿inne, except the Å¿inne againÅ¿t the holy GhoÅ¿t, whilk is euer puniÅ¿hed with finall impenitencie.</p>
                     <p>As for the 10. of the <hi>Manichees</hi> hereÅ¿ie, their doctrine was as <hi>AuguÅ¿tine</hi> Å¿ayes there, that <hi>BaptiÅ¿me Å¿erued nothing for Å¿aluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to anye: and that none, who followed their Å¿ect, Å¿hould be baptized.</hi> and therefore they broght in a contempt of BaptiÅ¿me, whilk is contrarie our doctrine. For we teache that ChriÅ¿tians and their children is to be baptized: and that the contempt of it is damnable, Å¿uppoÅ¿e not the want of it.</p>
                     <p>As for the 11. and 12. hereÅ¿ies, we contemne not faÅ¿tings that are appointed by the Kirk, for lawful cauÅ¿es: but we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that they Å¿hould be tied to certaine and prefixed dayes, as your Kirk does: and we thinke it no hereÅ¿ie to faÅ¿t on the Lords day, more then other dayes: both to Å¿tirre vp our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and to make vs more meet to holy and Å¿pirituall exerciÅ¿es, becauÅ¿e it is not contrary to the word of God. As for <hi>Leo</hi> his EpiÅ¿tle, it is wrong quoted, for it Å¿hould be EpiÅ¿t. 91. and there faÅ¿ting on the Lords day is not like ours: for they faÅ¿ted on the Lordes day, becauÅ¿e they beleeued not that ChriÅ¿t was a true man, as <hi>Leo</hi> in that Å¿ame place teÅ¿tifies whilk you will not Å¿ay your Å¿elfe that we do, for we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him to be a true man.</p>
                     <p>As for the 13. hereÅ¿ie of the <hi>PepuÅ¿ians</hi> and <hi>Collyridians,</hi> their doctrine was that wemen might be BiÅ¿hops, and Elders, &amp; might vÅ¿e theÅ¿e publick functions, as theÅ¿e places whilk ye haue quoted, teÅ¿tifies: whilk is not our doctrine, but rather yours, who permits wemen to baptize, in caÅ¿e of neceÅ¿sity. That they denied orders to be a Sacrament, there is no Å¿ik thing to be found in theÅ¿e places whilk ye quote heir.</p>
                     <p>As for the 14. hereÅ¿ie of the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> if they denied that theÅ¿e who were accuÅ¿ed of any Å¿candalous offence, &amp; guilty thereof; Å¿hould make their confeÅ¿sion of it to God, his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ters, &amp; the Congregation, for to take away the offence of it, then they erred, and our doctrine and practiÅ¿e condemnes this: but if they denied the abÅ¿olute neceÅ¿sity of your auri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular confeÅ¿sions, then is it no errour, becauÅ¿e there is na Å¿ik
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:20312:124"/> thing commanded in the whole Scriptures of God. Nowe as for the teÅ¿timonie of <hi>Boetius,</hi> I haue not Å¿eene it. As for their Å¿econd hereÅ¿ie concerning BaptiÅ¿me, they taught, as <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tine</hi> reportes in that place, <hi>that BaptiÅ¿me was not needfull to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, becauÅ¿e they were borne without original Å¿inne,</hi> as they taught whilk is an hereÅ¿ie indeede: but this is a calumnie to aÅ¿criue it to vs, for we teach that children are borne in originall Å¿in, and Å¿o Å¿houlde be baptized. And Å¿urelie this hereÅ¿ie rather aggrees to you, who teaches that <hi>Marie</hi> was not borne in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall Å¿inne, and therefore Å¿he needed not to be baptized.</p>
                     <p>As for the laÅ¿t of the <hi>DonatiÅ¿ts,</hi> denying the order of Monks. I anÅ¿were: firÅ¿t, your PapiÅ¿ticall and Idolatrous Monkes,
<note place="margin">Bellari 2. de indulgentus</note> are farre different from theÅ¿e whilk <hi>AuguÅ¿tine</hi> and <hi>ChryÅ¿oÅ¿tome</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, and theÅ¿e of the Primitiue Kirk. For firÅ¿t they were bound to no preÅ¿cript forme of diet, apparell, or any thing elÅ¿e, by Å¿olemne vowes of wilfull pouertie, and perpetual co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinencie, as yours are, next, the former Monks remained in the order of priuate men, and laicks, and had no thing to do with EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall charges, whilk was afterward broken by Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the 4. <hi>anno</hi> 606. But yours are not Å¿o: they haue EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall charges, and are more then priuate men. And laÅ¿t of all, Å¿uppoÅ¿e their kinde of life was mixed with Å¿ome Å¿uperÅ¿tition, for the <hi>enuious man Å¿one Å¿owed the popple amongÅ¿t the good Å¿eede, and the myÅ¿tery of iniquity began Å¿one to worke:</hi> yet their religion was not defiled with Idolatrie, worÅ¿hipping of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, praiers to Saints, opinion of merite, the Å¿acrifice of the MaÅ¿Å¿e, and other abhominations wherewith your PapiÅ¿ticall Monkes are defiled. Next I Å¿ay, theÅ¿e Monkes and religious orders of yours, hes not their foundation within the foure corners of the Scripture of God.</p>

                     <p>Now heere was all the cauÅ¿e (ChriÅ¿tian reader) that made (MaiÅ¿ter <hi>Gilbert</hi>) Å¿o oft to cry out of vs, that wee renued old condemned hereÅ¿ies, whereof Å¿ome are Å¿ik as wee our Å¿elues condemne, and Å¿ome are Å¿ik whilk doe better aggree vnto themÅ¿elues, nor vnto vs: &amp; Å¿ome hereÅ¿ies he forceth vpon vs whilk wee neuer taught nor maintayned: and Å¿ome are Å¿ik whilk are not hereÅ¿ies indeede, but aggreable to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of God. So that if we erre in theÅ¿e, Å¿uffer vs to erre with IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t and his ApoÅ¿tles. Now to anÅ¿wer to your argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whilk ye bring. What euer was hereÅ¿ie in olde times, is hereÅ¿ie yet, and the defenders thereof heretickes. I anÅ¿wer, if ye define hereÅ¿ie to be an error obÅ¿tinately maintained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t the Scriptures of God: I graunt your propoÅ¿ition. But if ye define hereÅ¿ies in generall, to be whatÅ¿omeuer any one Father or Doctor, or Å¿ome more hes rebuked as an hereÅ¿ie; then I deny it, for Å¿undrie of the fathers hes maintained er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors themÅ¿elues againÅ¿t the Scripture, and hes accuÅ¿ed Å¿ome doctrine to bee hereÅ¿ies, whilk hes bene aggreeable to the trueth of God, whilk you will not deny, I hope. For if you would, I could proue it both of the Fathers, Councels, and your owne Popes. Now to your aÅ¿Å¿umption. But theÅ¿e former heads, Å¿ay ye, whilk ye haue Å¿et downe with manye the like was hereÅ¿ies in olde tymes, and the defenders thereof here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, as teÅ¿tifieth the auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t Fathers.

And therefore, your concluÅ¿ion fals not vpon vs, who hes renewed no olde condemned he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reÅ¿ie, and therefore is not heretickes. And where you Å¿aye many other like.

                     <p>It is not impoÅ¿sible to proue your Popes to be the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriÅ¿t. It hes beene prooued alreadie by the learned on our Å¿ide: to the whilk you, and all your Cleargie of Rome is not able to anÅ¿were. It hes bene taught &amp; Å¿ealed with the blood of infinite nombers of ChriÅ¿tians: and I haue not taken Å¿o long a tearme as you haue Å¿et downe heir, and yet, I hope, I haue proued it Å¿ufficiently. Put all your might to diÅ¿proue it if you can. And as to that threatning of yours, MaiÅ¿ter <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> wherein ye Å¿ay that all theÅ¿e, who will not openly and priuatelie obey the Pope, &amp;c, muÅ¿t drinke of the wine of the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:20312:128"/> wrath of God. If it may be beleeued, then howe doth this Å¿tand firÅ¿t with your Popes pardons, whereby he giues men pardon or licence to profeÅ¿Å¿e, Å¿ubÅ¿criue, and Å¿weare to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: as it is reported that Å¿ome of your owne religion hes confeÅ¿Å¿ed it? Next, howe Å¿tands it with the diÅ¿simulation of your IeÅ¿uites, and Å¿eminarie PrieÅ¿ts when they come to any place where our religion is openlie profeÅ¿Å¿ed? Thirdly, what comfort is this whilk ye haue pronounced to your own poor countriemen, who doe not openly avow PapiÅ¿trie, but hes Å¿ubÅ¿criued and communicate with vs? Is this an open profeÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion, or not? And if it be not, if ye be a true Prophet, then muÅ¿t they drinke of the wine of the wrath of God, then muÅ¿t they be condemned in Hel by your iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t, becauÅ¿e they profeÅ¿Å¿e him not openlie. And laÅ¿t of all, if this threatning of yours be true, then beÅ¿ide the many infinite thouÅ¿ands who profeÅ¿Å¿es him to be the AntichriÅ¿t, you condemne to Hell all the Greeke and EaÅ¿tern Kirks, who in nomber far exceedes them who obeyes you, and all the Kirks that hes bene 600. yeere and more after ChriÅ¿t: for they obeyed not the Pope openlie nor priuatlie as ChriÅ¿ts Vicare ouer them, as I haue prooued before. And alÅ¿o you condemne a nomber of your Anti-Popes to Hell, with their Cardinals, BiÅ¿hops, &amp; Kirks who followed them: for they gaue out themÅ¿elues to bee Popes, and did not obey the other. As alÅ¿o a nomber of the Fathers of your owne religion, who in two general councels the one of <hi>ConÅ¿tance,</hi> where there was almoÅ¿t 1000. Fathers: the other of <hi>BaÅ¿ile,</hi> did not obey the pope, in defining general councels to be aboue the Pope. So, if ye Å¿peak trueth, infinite millions of ChriÅ¿tians in all ages, and innumerable Kirks, &amp; thouÅ¿ands of your owne religion are condemned to hell. But this is falÅ¿e, MaiÅ¿ter <hi>Gilbert,</hi> and who will beleeue you? And to the end nowe my concluÅ¿ion yet holdes Å¿ure, that Å¿eeing his kingdome is that <hi>Å¿econd beaÅ¿t that hes two hornes like the Lamb and Å¿peakes like the Dragon:</hi> and himÅ¿elf is that <hi>man of Å¿inne,</hi>

                     <p>This for the name: nowe to the matter.

The matter of our controuerÅ¿ie therefore is: Whether IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, God and man, his bodie and blood be perÅ¿onally and corporally offered vp, in your Å¿acrifice of the MaÅ¿Å¿e, (as ye call it) and whether this your Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice be a propitiatorie Å¿acrifice, for the Å¿innes of the quicke and the deade: this your Kirk affirmes and holdes, and this we deny.

Next, as <hi>MelchiÅ¿edech</hi> was with out father and mother, beginning, and ending, the Scripture not mentioning of it, Å¿o was ChriÅ¿t. Thirdly, as <hi>MelchiÅ¿edech</hi> was greater then <hi>Aaron,</hi> and had a more excellent PrieÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode then the Leuiticall PrieÅ¿t-hoode, Å¿o was ChriÅ¿ts. But neuer a word heir, of a Å¿acrifice of bread and wine, wherein <hi>MelchiÅ¿edech</hi> Å¿houlde haue reÅ¿embled the Å¿acrifice of your MaÅ¿Å¿e, as ye Å¿uppoÅ¿e. So you find out heir that whilk the Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God found not out: and Å¿o ye make your Å¿elf wiÅ¿er then the holy GhoÅ¿te in his EpiÅ¿tle. But we will learne not to bee <hi>wiÅ¿e aboue that whilk is written,</hi> and to Å¿earche no further, then the Å¿pirit of God hes found out already. And Å¿uppoÅ¿e it were graunted to you (whilk yee are neuer able to proue,) that <hi>MelchiÅ¿edech</hi> did offer vp bread and wine yet what to doe hes this with your diueliÅ¿h abhomination of your MaÅ¿Å¿e, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ye Å¿ay the Å¿ubÅ¿tance of bread and wine is gone away, only the formes remayning. For if your Å¿acrifice in the MaÅ¿Å¿e, be like the Å¿acrifice of <hi>MelchiÅ¿edech,</hi> then the Å¿ubÅ¿tance of breade and wine Å¿hould remaine as it did in the Å¿acrifice of <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿edech,</hi> and the bread and wine Å¿hould be offered vp, and not ChriÅ¿ts body and blood, as bread and wine only were offerd vp in <hi>MelchiÅ¿edech</hi> his Å¿acrifice, So then, either <hi>MelchiÅ¿edech</hi> his Å¿acrifice is not a tipe of your Å¿acrifice in the MaÅ¿Å¿e, or els true bread and wine remaines in the Å¿acrament, and not ChriÅ¿t his bodie and blood whilk is offered vp. ChooÅ¿e you then, whether you will deny your Å¿acrifice to be according to the order of <hi>MelchiÅ¿edech,</hi> or elÅ¿e will you let goe your reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ence, your TranÅ¿ubÅ¿tantiation, and your perÅ¿onal offering vp of ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us in your abhominable MaÅ¿Å¿e, for one you muÅ¿t doe. Thirdly, if ChriÅ¿t offered vp Å¿ik a Å¿acrifice at his

<note place="margin">Ioh. 19.28.</note> then muÅ¿t it follow that ChriÅ¿t fulfilled that figure per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitely: and Å¿o the Å¿ame Å¿acrifice needs no more to be offered vp againe, and Å¿o heir will followe the deÅ¿olation of your MaÅ¿Å¿e-PrieÅ¿ts, whoÅ¿e worke is chiefly in repeating of this Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice againe. Fourthlie, I would aske you, Whether is this Å¿acrifice, whilk ye Å¿ay he offered vp according to the order of <hi>MelchiÅ¿edech</hi> in his laÅ¿t Å¿upper, one with that Å¿acrifice whilk he offered vp vpon the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>oce, or not? If it be one, then, I Å¿ay as he died and Å¿hed his blood on the croce, &amp; purchaÅ¿ed an euerlaÅ¿ting redemption by the Å¿ame: Å¿o this Å¿acrifice of your MaÅ¿Å¿e muÅ¿t be ioyned with his death, and Å¿hedding of his blood, and muÅ¿t haue the like vertue and effect to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme vs, and Å¿o two abÅ¿urdities will follow. The one, that ChriÅ¿t not only Å¿hould twiÅ¿e haue died, once in the Supper, and afterward vpon the croce: but alÅ¿o dies, and is crucified continuallie: in your MaÅ¿Å¿e, &amp; yet the Scripture Å¿ayes hee dyed but once. The other, that that Å¿acrifice of his vppon the croce is Å¿uperfluous: for what needed him to die againe to redeeme mankinde, Å¿ince the firÅ¿te offering of himÅ¿elfe in the Supper was a Å¿ufficient redemption. For if his Å¿acrifice vpon the croce was a Å¿ufficient redemption, whilk you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny: and if the Å¿acrifice of him in the Supper be one with that: of neceÅ¿sitie it muÅ¿t followe, that as his Å¿acrifice v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the croce was a Å¿ufficient redemption: euen Å¿o his Å¿acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in the Supper muÅ¿t be a Å¿ufficient redemption for man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. And therefore
<note n="(s)" place="margin">

                        <hi>Alanus</hi> a great defender of your Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick faith, Å¿aith, according to the iudgement of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Trent, <hi>that the new couenant is founded on the blood of ChriÅ¿t offered vp in the Supper, before he was crucified: and that ChriÅ¿t was truly our PaÅ¿Å¿eouer the day before he Å¿uffered:</hi> and he Å¿ayes, <hi>This is the foundation of all ChriÅ¿tian doctrine, according to the iudgement of the councell.</hi> Nowe if this be true, that he was our PaÅ¿Å¿eouer, before hee died, and the couenant was founded in his blood whilk he offered vp in the Supper: then, certainly, ChriÅ¿t di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in vaine, whilk is more then blaÅ¿phemous: and Å¿o blaÅ¿phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous muÅ¿t that doctrine of your MaÅ¿Å¿e be, whilk carries
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:20312:136"/> with it Å¿ik a blaÅ¿phemie. And if you will Å¿ay, it is not the Å¿ame with that Å¿acrifice vpon the croce: then, I Å¿ay, firÅ¿t you are contrarie to your owne Kirk in this, who Å¿ayes, it is one with that Å¿acrifice of the croce. Next, ChriÅ¿t his body and blood is not offered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> in the Supper: for his body &amp; blood was offered vp vpon the croce, and Å¿o your MaÅ¿Å¿e is gone, or elÅ¿e make two ChriÅ¿ts: one in the Supper vnder the formes of bread and wine, whilk the DiÅ¿ciples Å¿awe not: and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who was offered vp vpon the croce, whilk was Å¿eene of all. So whether will ye go, and vnto what Å¿ide will ye turne you, MaiÅ¿ter Gilbert, for the vpholde of your MaÅ¿Å¿e? for there are rocks and Å¿and beds on euery Å¿ide. So neither did ChriÅ¿t offer vp himÅ¿elf in a Å¿acrifice at all in his laÅ¿t Supper, neither did he it according to the order of <hi>MelchiÅ¿edech.</hi> But now let vs Å¿ee how ye proue this Å¿acrifice out of the inÅ¿tituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And Å¿eing this point of doctrine is Å¿ik a waightie point, as whereupon the Å¿aluation and damnation of Å¿oules does hing:
<note place="margin">The inÅ¿titution of the Supper makes nothing for the Å¿acrifice of the MaÅ¿Å¿e.</note> therefore I pray thee (ChriÅ¿tian Reader) deceaue not thine owne Å¿oule to thy euerlaÅ¿ting perdition, but take good head what ground is in the inÅ¿titution for this their Å¿acrifice, for if they prooue it not heir, it will neuer be prooued by the Scripture.

And vnto whome gaue he it? the text Å¿ayes, <hi>Vnto his diÅ¿ciples,</hi> both in <hi>Matthew, Marke,</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> all with one conÅ¿ent. Now,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:20312:136"/> that whilk was giuen to his DiÅ¿ciples was not properly offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp in a Å¿acrifice: for a Å¿acrifice is an offering to God. And the text Å¿ayes heir, <hi>He gaue it to his DiÅ¿ciples.</hi> So there is not a Å¿illabe in the inÅ¿titution, that can make for your pretended Å¿acrifice.

And laÅ¿t of all ye Å¿ay, <hi>Hee gaue his body and blood to his DiÅ¿ciples to be eaten:</hi> He gaue it Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituallie, and they did eate it Å¿pirituallie: and he gaue the Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of his body and blood, the bread and wine corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to them, and they did eate them corporally, Å¿uppoÅ¿e for a Å¿pirituall vÅ¿e and end.

                        <hi>Verely, verely from hence forth Å¿hall I not drinke of the fruite of this vine with you.</hi> That whilk he gaue his ApoÅ¿tles to drinke corporally in the latter Supper was the fruite of the vine, (Å¿o the EuangeliÅ¿tes Å¿aies.) But ChriÅ¿ts blood was not the frutie of the vine: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was not his blood whilk they corporally dranke, but wine, whilk was the fruite of the Vine-tree. I goe forwarde. And when he had done this, ye Å¿ay, <hi>He commanded his DiÅ¿ciples,</hi> that is, <hi>the lawfull PaÅ¿tors of the Kirk to doe the Å¿ame for the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of him to the end of the world.</hi> That is true, that whilk he did heir, he commanded to be done by his DiÅ¿ciples to the end of the world: but neuer a Å¿illabe heir that he offered vp his bodie and blood vnder the formes of bread and wine in the Supper, in a propitiatory Å¿acrifice for the quick and the dead: Therefore he commanded not this Å¿acrifice of your MaÅ¿Å¿e to be done to the end of the world. And whereas yee reÅ¿trict this commandement, <hi>Doe this,</hi> only to the PaÅ¿tors, ye haue to vnderÅ¿tand that as there is Å¿ome thing heir whilk ChriÅ¿t did, whilk is proper to them, as to be the diÅ¿penÅ¿ers of theÅ¿e heauenly myÅ¿teries: Å¿o there is Å¿ome actions heir, whilk is common alÅ¿o with them to the people: as to receaue, to eate, to drink theÅ¿e Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ts of his body &amp; blood in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance. Seing therefore this commandement, <hi>Doe this,</hi> is to be referred to the whole actions of the Supper: and Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there is Å¿ome actions in the Å¿ame, whilk the other ChriÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans Å¿hould doe alÅ¿o: Therefore this commandement, <hi>Do this,</hi> is not to be reÅ¿tricted to the office of the PaÅ¿tors only, (whilk ye doe) but common with them to the actions of the people. Now to your concluÅ¿ion: Seing (Å¿ay ye) your PrieÅ¿tes does the Å¿ame in this Å¿acrifice, whilk our Sauiour did: howe can I Å¿ay that your religion in this, was not inÅ¿tituted by ChriÅ¿t.
<note place="margin">The preiÅ¿ts in the maÅ¿Å¿e doth not the Å¿ame thing that ChriÅ¿t either command<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed or did him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elfe in the latter Supper.</note> If ye doe the Å¿ame that he did, indeed I will graunt you it. But you doe not the Å¿ame whilk our Sauiour did: Therefore your religion in this is not inÅ¿tituted by IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t. The whilk I prooue. FirÅ¿t, ChriÅ¿t took bread and wine in this Sacrament
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:20312:138"/> and gaue it to be eaten and drunken: and bread was eaten, &amp; wine was drunken by his DiÅ¿ciples.
<note place="margin">The difference betwene the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Supper, and the abhominable Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the MaÅ¿Å¿e.</note> But your PrieÅ¿t takes bread and wine, &amp; coniures the Å¿ubÅ¿tance of it away by your TranÅ¿ubÅ¿tantiation, and onely remaines the formes of the breade and wine behinde: therefore you doe not the thing whilk ChriÅ¿t did. Secondly, ChriÅ¿t tooke bread and brake it you take bread and hangs it vp, and keepes it in a boxe, to carrie to the Å¿eik, and in proceÅ¿sions. Thirdly, ChriÅ¿t tooke bread and gaue it to his ApoÅ¿tles: your PrieÅ¿ts like gluttons in the Å¿acrifice of your MaÅ¿Å¿e eates it vp euery whit himÅ¿elfe alone. Fourthly, ChriÅ¿t giues a Sacrament to Å¿tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>gthen mens faith: but your PrieÅ¿tes giues a Å¿acrifice to redeeme mens Å¿oules. Fiftly, ChriÅ¿t gaue it to be eaten, your PrieÅ¿ts giues it to be worÅ¿hipped. Sextly, ChriÅ¿t gaue bread, your PrieÅ¿tes Å¿ay they giue God. Seuenthly, ChriÅ¿t gaue the Cupe to his DiÅ¿ciples, Å¿aying, <hi>Drinke ye all of this,</hi> your PrieÅ¿t drinkes all himÅ¿elfe, and takes away the Cupe from the people, both in your Å¿acrifice and Å¿acrament. Eightly, ChriÅ¿t inÅ¿tituted the Supper, and commanded the Kirk to celebrate the Å¿ame, as he had inÅ¿tituted it: but the MaÅ¿Å¿e hes bene clamped vp by many Å¿undry Popes: one made the <hi>Confiteor,</hi> another the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troit:</hi> another the <hi>KyriceleiÅ¿on,</hi> another the <hi>Gloria in excelÅ¿is:</hi> and Å¿o forth of the reÅ¿t, as Å¿halbe prooued afterwarde. Ninthly, ChriÅ¿t intending to celebrate his Supper, changeth not his garment: but the PrieÅ¿t going to Å¿ay his MaÅ¿Å¿e, doth naught but cloth and vn-cloath, &amp; euery garment carrying a great myÅ¿terie. The PrieÅ¿t Å¿aying MaÅ¿Å¿e muÅ¿te haue his head and beard Å¿hauen, and vpon his head a circle of haire, whilk they call a crowne: imitating the PrieÅ¿tes of the Gentiles in this, <hi>Baruh chap.</hi> 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 30. and not ChriÅ¿t and his ApoÅ¿tles. Tenth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ChriÅ¿t in the Supper vÅ¿ed common bread, but the PopiÅ¿h PrieÅ¿t muÅ¿t expreÅ¿ly vÅ¿e other manner of bread, baked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt two irons, whilk is properly, Wafers. Elleuenthlye, ChriÅ¿t made his Supper vpon a Table, the PopiÅ¿he PrieÅ¿t muÅ¿t haue a conÅ¿ecrate Altar, with Å¿ome peeces of relickes put in the hole of it, or elÅ¿e a marble Å¿tone, in the borders whereof are little peeces of cloth, whilk they call <hi>corporales,</hi> to
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:20312:138" rendition="simple:additions"/> Å¿ay his MaÅ¿Å¿e on. Twelfthly, ChriÅ¿t in the celebrating of the Supper, preached &amp; taught his ApoÅ¿tles: the PopiÅ¿he PrieÅ¿t mumbleth betwixt his teeth certaine praiers: he turneth to and from the altar, one while his back, another while his face to the people: now goeth he from one Å¿ide of the altar vnto another: now he Å¿ingeth with an high voice, now with a lowe voice: now he lifts vp his armes, now he caÅ¿teth them downe. Briefly, he Å¿eemeth to be a man whollie mad, not knowing what countenance for to vÅ¿e. Thirtenthly, ChriÅ¿t in the Supper Å¿pake in a vulgar tongue, that al might vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tand: the PopiÅ¿h PrieÅ¿t in their MaÅ¿Å¿es, Å¿peakes in a Å¿trange tongue, whilk the moÅ¿t part of themÅ¿elues vnderÅ¿tands not. Fourtenthly, ChriÅ¿t firÅ¿t brake the bread, and then gaue it to his ApoÅ¿tles: the prophane PrieÅ¿te firÅ¿t Å¿peaketh certaine wordes ouer the bread in his MaÅ¿Å¿e, and then breaketh it, (or the accidents of it, as they Å¿ay) at their pleaÅ¿ure. Fiftenthly, ChriÅ¿t after he had broken the bread Å¿ayes, This is my body the PopiÅ¿h PrieÅ¿t Å¿peakes the words, without breaking of the bread, and not content with the words of ChriÅ¿t, he addeth this word <hi>enim</hi> vnto them. Therefore you cannot M. <hi>Gilbert,</hi> but Å¿peake againÅ¿t the light of your owne conÅ¿cience, when you Å¿ay that your PrieÅ¿tes does the Å¿ame in their MaÅ¿Å¿e that ChriÅ¿t did in the Supper, and heir I appeale your conÅ¿cience before the terrible and euerliuing God, and before IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t that Å¿hall iudge the quick and the deade, whether ye doe not Å¿peake in this againÅ¿t the light of your owne conÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or not, and whether your PrieÅ¿ts in your MaÅ¿Å¿e, does the Å¿ame whilk ChriÅ¿t did in the Supper or not? Thinke you not that you muÅ¿t Å¿tand before the liuing God, and giue a reckoning of theÅ¿e things. Repent in time, and ceaÅ¿e to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue the Å¿oules of your countriemen any more. But to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this: What adoe hes your MaÅ¿Å¿e with the Supper of ChriÅ¿t? what likeneÅ¿Å¿e is there betweene the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? In the Supper whilk ChriÅ¿t inÅ¿tituted in the Scripture, we are remembred of his death &amp; paÅ¿sion vpon the Croce, whereby he appeaÅ¿ed the wrath of God for our Å¿innes, and of our duty towards him: whereby we acknowledge in our
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:20312:139"/> conÅ¿ciences, that we are obliÅ¿hed to die to Å¿inne, Å¿eing it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooued the eternall Å¿onne of God by his death vppon the croce, to redeeme vs from the Å¿ame: vpon the whilk ariÅ¿es an earneÅ¿t thankeÅ¿giuing in the hearts and mouthes of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie true ChriÅ¿tian, for Å¿o great a Å¿aluation, purchaÅ¿ed Å¿o won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully, as by the death of the eternal Å¿onne of God. In your Å¿acrifice of the MaÅ¿Å¿e is there any Å¿ik thing? Is there any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his death and Å¿uffering there? Is his death Å¿hewen to the people in a knowne language that they may vnderÅ¿tand it? Is there any acknowledging of any dutie there, for his death? Is there any true thankeÅ¿giuing there? No, none. But in Å¿tead of theÅ¿e, a heape of wordes in an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne language, and a diuerÅ¿ity of ApiÅ¿h geÅ¿tures, &amp; Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿he and Iuglers tricks, to feede the eyes of the poore peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whilk neither the people, nor yet many of your Å¿elues do vnderÅ¿tand. In the Supper we are alÅ¿o admoniÅ¿hed of our Å¿pirituall coniunction with our neighbour, and of our duetie towards him, in that we are all partakers of one bread, made of many graines, and of one wine made of many grapes: to Å¿ignifie vnto vs that we are all renewed and redeemed by one blood, members of one bodie, liuing by one Å¿pirit, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life, motion, &amp; feeling all from one head, being one with him, and Å¿o one with others, whereby followes our mutuall duties one toward another. In your MaÅ¿Å¿e there is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the bread made of many graines, and of the wine made of many grapes, to Å¿ignify this coniunction and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, either with ChriÅ¿t our heade or amongÅ¿t our Å¿elues, the PrieÅ¿t eating and drinking all himÅ¿elfe. In the Supper, according to ChriÅ¿t his inÅ¿titution by giuing, taking, eating, and drinking of the breade and wine by all the DiÅ¿ciples, whereby our bodily life is nouriÅ¿hed and Å¿trengthned, is not only Å¿ignified and repreÅ¿ented our Å¿pirituall grouth in that Å¿pirituall communion with him, whereon our Å¿pirituall life depends: but alÅ¿o in the Å¿ame, all the faithfull doeth truelie by faith eate and drinke Å¿piritually his fleÅ¿he &amp; blood, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are made one with himÅ¿elfe, fleÅ¿h of his fleÅ¿he, and bone of his bones, whereby they are Å¿trengthned in that Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:20312:139"/> life, and confirmed in the hope of that glorie. But is there any Å¿ik thing in your PapiÅ¿ticall Å¿acrifice? Is there any giuing, and taking, eating, and drinking of bread and wine by the faithful, either to repreÅ¿ent our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>munion with ChriÅ¿t and amongÅ¿t our Å¿elues, or to Å¿trengthen vs in that Å¿pirituall life through his coniunction. Doe the poore people eate or drinke, either bodily, or Å¿piritually in your MaÅ¿Å¿e? Is there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny action there to Å¿tirre vp their conÅ¿cience? or any inÅ¿tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to incres their knowledge? Are they ought but idle be holders of a pretended myÅ¿tery, whilk is both dumb &amp; deaf, and of a PrieÅ¿t that eates and drinkes all himÅ¿elf alone? So that in Å¿tead of theÅ¿e heauenly diÅ¿hes, whilk our louing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doeth propine vnto vs, vppon his Table in the Supper, what is there in your abhominable Å¿acrifices, but a feeding with huskes, an apiÅ¿he game, and Iuglers tricks to feede the fantaÅ¿ies of poore people, that Å¿ees but vnderÅ¿tands not, that heares, but they knowe not what. So that in trueth there is as great likeneÅ¿Å¿e betwixt ChriÅ¿ts Supper, and your MaÅ¿Å¿e, as is betweene the Table of the Lorde,
<note place="margin">Some of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elues hes confeÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>Å¿ed and written that al men may know it, that the MaÅ¿Å¿e is but an vnwritten Tradi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion, and is not in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>Å¿tituted by chriÅ¿t in the Scripture</note> and the Table of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels, and light with darkeneÅ¿Å¿e. Seing therefore there is Å¿ik a difference betwixt your Å¿acrifice in the MaÅ¿Å¿e, and ChriÅ¿t his Supper, as hes beene Å¿eene: therefore your PrieÅ¿ts does not the Å¿ame in the MaÅ¿Å¿e, whilk our Sauiour did in the laÅ¿t Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. And therefore howe can you Å¿ay, that your religion in this is inÅ¿tituted by ChriÅ¿t? And this is Å¿o euident, that Å¿ome of your owne Doctors and learned writers hes beene forced to confeÅ¿Å¿e the Å¿ame. As

Is the new TeÅ¿tament (thinke ye) more obÅ¿cure
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:20312:143"/> then the olde TeÅ¿tament? (whilk is abÅ¿urde to Å¿ay.) Shall the olde TeÅ¿tament be cleare in Å¿etting downe the Å¿acrifices and all the rites thereof, whilk is but the Å¿haddowe: and Å¿hould not the newe TeÅ¿tament, haue bene at the leaÅ¿t, as cleare in Å¿etting downe the Å¿acrifice of the newe TeÅ¿tament, whilk ye affirme to be the MaÅ¿Å¿e, if it were Å¿ik, what an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿urde thing is this? ChriÅ¿tian reader aÅ¿Å¿ure thy Å¿elf, the Lord IeÅ¿us would haue dealt as louinglie, and plainly with thee, in Å¿etting downe the Å¿acrifice of the MaÅ¿Å¿e in the newe TeÅ¿ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (if euer he had inÅ¿tituted Å¿ik a Å¿acrifice) as he was in Å¿etting downe the Å¿acrifices of the olde TeÅ¿tament. But thou may aÅ¿Å¿ure thy Å¿elfe, and thy conÅ¿cience may leane vnto it, Å¿ince he hath not Å¿o much as once expreÅ¿Å¿ed it in all the new TeÅ¿tament, therefore he hes neuer appointed it. Secondly, I Å¿ay, in all the places of Scripture whereÅ¿oeuer the ApoÅ¿tles Å¿peaks of the Å¿acrifices, whilk ChriÅ¿tians Å¿hould offer vp, they euer Å¿peake of Å¿pirituall Å¿acrifices, and neuer Å¿peakes of this their externall Å¿acrifice of the MaÅ¿Å¿e.

We will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue them rather then you. Thirdly, that doctrine whilk is expreÅ¿ly gainÅ¿aide by the Scripture, muÅ¿t be falÅ¿e:) this you cannot deny:) but this your doctrine concerning the often and daily offering vp of IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, his body and blood in Å¿acrifice in your MaÅ¿Å¿e, is expreÅ¿ly gainÅ¿aid by the Å¿cripture: for the Scripture Å¿ayes in Å¿undry places, that <hi>he hes once offred vp himÅ¿elfe,</hi> neuer to offer vp himÅ¿elfe againe, <hi>Heb</hi> 10.10. <hi>By the whilk will we are Å¿anctified, euen by the offering vp of IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t once made.</hi> 11. <hi>And euery PrieÅ¿t Å¿tandeth daylie miniÅ¿tring, and oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times offereth one manner of offering, whilk cannot take away Å¿inne</hi> 11. <hi>But this man after he had offered one Å¿acrifice for Å¿innes, Å¿itteth
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:20312:143"/> for euer at the right hand of God.</hi> 14. <hi>For with one offering hath hee conÅ¿ecrated for euer them that are Å¿anctified. Heb.</hi> 9.24. <hi>ChriÅ¿t hes entred into the very heauen to appeare now in the Å¿ight of God for vs, not that he Å¿hould offer himÅ¿elf often, &amp;c.</hi> 28. <hi>So ChriÅ¿t was once offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to take away the Å¿innes of many. Heb.</hi> 7.27. <hi>ChriÅ¿t died once, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> he offered vp himÅ¿elf,</hi> Seing the Scripture therefore affirmes Å¿o plainlie, that ChriÅ¿t <hi>once offered vp himÅ¿elfe,</hi> and you affirm that in your abhominable Å¿acrifice, he offers vp himÅ¿elfe often: Å¿ince the Scripture Å¿ayes, the offering vp of ChriÅ¿t is <hi>once only</hi> and ye Å¿ay it is often in your MaÅ¿Å¿e: Therefore this doctrine of yours is plaine againÅ¿t the expreÅ¿Å¿e Å¿ayings of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. For Å¿uppoÅ¿e ye will haue an vnbloody offering vp of ChriÅ¿t, yet the Scripture only acknowledges this bloody of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering vp of himÅ¿elf vpon the croce.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, I will aske you to what purpoÅ¿e Å¿erues the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿onall Å¿acrifice of ChriÅ¿t in your MaÅ¿Å¿e? It muÅ¿t be for one of two: to wit, either to Å¿atisfy for our Å¿innes, (and therefore ye call it a propitiatorie Å¿acrifice) or elÅ¿e to apply that Å¿atisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on once made by his death vppon the croce vnto vs, (the whilk yee affirme alÅ¿o of it:) But for neither of theÅ¿e is IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t to be offered vp againe: therefore for no cauÅ¿e is hee to be Å¿acrificed in your MaÅ¿Å¿e. Not for the firÅ¿t, to Å¿atisfie for our Å¿innes, becauÅ¿e the Scripture Å¿ayes plainly, that he hes Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tisfied for our Å¿innes, by his once oblation vppon thh Croce, neuer to die againe, and therefore our Sauiour Å¿ayes vppon the * Croce, <hi>It is finiÅ¿hed.</hi> And our redemption and Å¿atisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> is aÅ¿criued only to his death once made,
<note place="margin">Heb. 1. &amp; 9. &amp; 10 Ioh. 19.28. Bellar. lib. 1. do MiÅ¿Å¿a. cap. 25</note> and his blood once Å¿hed. And your Å¿elues will not deny this, but the death of ChriÅ¿t is a Å¿ufficient ranÅ¿ome and Å¿atisfaction for all the Å¿ins of the world, and therefore <hi>Bellarmine</hi> graunts this, that <hi>the vertue of his once offering vp vpon the croce, is infinite and euerlaÅ¿ting, to Å¿anctifie vs: Å¿o that there needes not another Å¿acrifice of the croce, or the repetition of the Å¿ame.</hi> And the treuth of this is manifeÅ¿t: for if ChriÅ¿t muÅ¿t be offered vp in the MaÅ¿Å¿e to Å¿atisfie for our Å¿innes, he muÅ¿t die againe, and Å¿uffer againe. For what is it to Å¿atisfie God, but to pay to God that whilk we owe? And what owe we vnto him for our Å¿innes, but death: for death is the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:20312:144"/> Å¿tipend of Å¿inne? So that to Å¿atisfie God for our Å¿innes, is to die for our Å¿innes: and therefore we Å¿ay, ChriÅ¿t hes once Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied for our Å¿innes, becauÅ¿e he hes once payed our debt, whilk is death: that is, he hes once died for our Å¿innes. So the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> either ChriÅ¿t hes not fully Å¿atisfied for our Å¿innes, by his once death vpon the Croce, (whilk is impiety to thinke) or elÅ¿e the Lord craues a debt already payed, ouer againe: (whilk is blaÅ¿phemy) or elÅ¿e ChriÅ¿t needs not to be offered vp in your MaÅ¿Å¿e, to Å¿atisfie for our Å¿innes. And Å¿o your Å¿acrifice of the MaÅ¿Å¿e availles not for to Å¿atisfie for our Å¿innes.</p>
                     <p>Let vs come to the next: If ye will Å¿ay, he is offered vp in the MaÅ¿Å¿e for to apply the vertue of the death of ChriÅ¿t vnto vs, (whilk your Kirk alÅ¿o Å¿ayes.) FirÅ¿t, I Å¿ay, ChriÅ¿t is applyed to vs, when he is offered, not to God in a Å¿acrifice, but to vs in the word and Sacraments: therefore he Å¿hould not be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered vp to God in a Å¿acrifice, but offered to vs in his word &amp; Sacraments, that he may be applied to vs: for it is the worde and Sacraments whilk outwardlye applyes ChriÅ¿t and his death to vs, and not a Å¿acrifice: for in a Å¿acrifice the thing whilk is Å¿acrificed, is offered to God, and not applied to vs. Next, I Å¿ay, if your Å¿acrifice Å¿erues but to apply the vertue of ChriÅ¿t his Å¿atisfaction vnto vs: then it is manifeÅ¿t, the Å¿atisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is alreadie made: for firÅ¿t the Å¿alue muÅ¿t be made, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it can be applied. So your Kirk heir erres, whilk Å¿ayes your Å¿acrifice of the MaÅ¿Å¿e is propitiatory to appeaÅ¿e the wrath of God, and alÅ¿o applicatorie to apply the Å¿ame to vs. I Å¿ay thirdly, if ChriÅ¿t Å¿hould be Å¿acrificed againe, that the vertue of his death may be made effectuall in vs: then alÅ¿o Å¿hould he be conceaued againe in the wombe of the Virgine borne againe, die againe, and riÅ¿e againe: that the vertue of his incarnation, birth, death, and reÅ¿urrection, Å¿hould be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed vnto vs: for will you Å¿ay, that he muÅ¿t be Å¿acrificed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to apply the vertue of his Å¿acrifice vpon the croce vnto vs: and what reaÅ¿on then can ye pretend for you wherefore he Å¿hould not be incarnate againe, die againe, and riÅ¿e again that the vertue of theÅ¿e may be applyed to vs? Doe you think this abÅ¿urde? What is the cauÅ¿e then that ye will not bluÅ¿he
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:20312:144"/> at the other. Fourthly, I Å¿ay, if your Å¿acrifice of the MaÅ¿Å¿e be an application of ChriÅ¿t his Å¿acrifice: then it is not the Å¿acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice it Å¿elf: for the applying of the Å¿alue, is not the Å¿alue it Å¿elf: and therefore Å¿ince you Å¿ay that it is the applying of ChriÅ¿t his Å¿acrifice, wherefore Å¿hould ye Å¿ay that ChriÅ¿t is Å¿acrificed in it: for theÅ¿e two cannot Å¿tand together. Fifthly, in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiÅ¿me, the Å¿acrifice of ChriÅ¿t, and the vertue of his death is truely applyed vnto vs: and yet ye will confeÅ¿Å¿e that ChriÅ¿t is not Å¿acrificed in BaptiÅ¿me. Wherefore then may not the vertue of this death and Å¿acrifice, be applyed to vs in the Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Supper, and yet he not Å¿acrificed againe in it. And laÅ¿t of all, neither you, neither any creature Å¿houlde ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point or make moe meanes of the applying of ChriÅ¿t &amp; his death to vs, then is Å¿et downe in his word: but his word on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Å¿ets downe the inwarde operation of Gods Å¿pirit applying it to vs, and faith vppon our part apprehending it: and the worde the Å¿acraments, and diÅ¿cipline proponing and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the Å¿ame vnto vs. But neuer a Å¿illabe in the whol Å¿crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that the Lord hes appointed your Å¿acrifice of the MaÅ¿Å¿e to apply the death of ChriÅ¿t vnto vs. Seing therefore your Å¿acrifice of the MaÅ¿Å¿e, neither Å¿atisfies for our Å¿ins (for ChriÅ¿t by his death hes done that Å¿ufficiently) nor yet applyes the Å¿atisfaction once made by the death of ChriÅ¿t vnto vs, (for that is done by the Å¿pirit and faith inwardly, &amp; by the worde Å¿acraments, and diÅ¿cipline outwardly, and that Å¿ufficiently:) Therefore your Å¿acrifice of the MaÅ¿Å¿e is needleÅ¿Å¿e, and Å¿erues to no vÅ¿e in the earth.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, the Scripture euer conioynes with the Å¿acrifice of ChriÅ¿t, his death: Å¿o that he cannot be Å¿acrificed but by dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as the Scripture plainly teÅ¿tifies, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.25. and 26. <hi>Not that he Å¿hould offer vp himÅ¿elfe often, for then muÅ¿t he haue often Å¿uffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the foundation of the world.</hi>

<pb n="238" facs="tcp:20312:145"/> Å¿ayes plainly that he hes <hi>but once died,</hi> and I trow you wil not Å¿ay that he is to die againe: Therefore Å¿eeing he cannot die againe, he cannot be offered vp againe: for the Scripture acknowledgeth no Å¿acrifice of ChriÅ¿t, but that whilk is ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with his death.</p>

                        <note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 10.18</note> that is, all externall propitiatory Å¿acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices ceaÅ¿es: but remiÅ¿sion of Å¿innes is already obtained by the death of ChriÅ¿t, as the
<note n="b)" place="margin">Heb. 1.3</note> Scripture teÅ¿tifies, and your Å¿elues will not deny. Therefore there needes no more obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ChriÅ¿t in your MaÅ¿Å¿e for the Å¿ame.</p>

                     <p>Further, the
<note n="(d" place="margin">Heb. 5. Heb. 7</note> Scripture acknowledges no other PrieÅ¿te of the new TeÅ¿tament, but ChriÅ¿t only, <hi>TheÅ¿e PrieÅ¿ts</hi> Å¿ayes the ApoÅ¿tle to the Hebrewes, Å¿peaking of the PrieÅ¿ts of the olde TeÅ¿tament, <hi>were many, becauÅ¿e death hindered them to indure: but he,</hi> Å¿peaking of ChriÅ¿t, <hi>becauÅ¿e he abydes for euer, hes an euerlaÅ¿ting PrieÅ¿t-hoode, whilk cannot paÅ¿Å¿e from one to another.</hi> So ChriÅ¿t is the only PrieÅ¿t of the newe TeÅ¿tament. Now if it be true whilk you Å¿ay, that ChriÅ¿t is offered vp in your MaÅ¿Å¿e, and that by your MaÅ¿Å¿e-PrieÅ¿tes, then are there moe PrieÅ¿ts of the newe TeÅ¿tament then ChriÅ¿t, whilk is plaine againÅ¿t the Scripturs. What will you Å¿ay to this? That ChriÅ¿t is the principal prieÅ¿t of the new TeÅ¿tament, and yours are Å¿econdary PrieÅ¿tes and
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:20312:145"/> vnder him, by whoÅ¿e miniÅ¿try he offereth vp himÅ¿elf to God But firÅ¿t, was not the PrieÅ¿ts of the old TeÅ¿tament onely Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condarie PrieÅ¿ts? this you will not deny, Å¿eing their Å¿acrifices were figures of his, and their PrieÅ¿thood figures of his PrieÅ¿t hoode. But the ApoÅ¿tle oppones the PrieÅ¿thoode of ChriÅ¿t, not to another principall PrieÅ¿thoode, but to the PrieÅ¿thood of men, whilk was but Å¿econdary, and Å¿ayes it cannot Å¿tande with that Å¿econdary PrieÅ¿thood in the olde TeÅ¿tament: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it cannot Å¿tand with your PrieÅ¿thoode of the new TeÅ¿ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment. And the reaÅ¿on whilk the ApoÅ¿tle alledges will not only Å¿erue, to exclude the PrieÅ¿ts of the old TeÅ¿tament, that was but Å¿ecundary PrieÅ¿ts alÅ¿o: but alÅ¿o all other Å¿acrificing PrieÅ¿ts whatÅ¿oeuer, of the propitiatory Å¿acrifice of the newe TeÅ¿tament. For the reaÅ¿on is, becauÅ¿e <hi>he bydes for euer, and hes a PrieÅ¿thoode whilk cannot paÅ¿Å¿e from one to another,</hi> whilk wil Å¿erue aÅ¿well againÅ¿t your MaÅ¿Å¿e-PrieÅ¿ts, as againÅ¿t them: for they are mortall as the PrieÅ¿ts of the old TeÅ¿tament were: and his PrieÅ¿thoode cannot paÅ¿Å¿e from one to another, as it might haue done amongÅ¿t the PrieÅ¿ts of the olde TeÅ¿tament, and alÅ¿o does amongÅ¿t your PrieÅ¿ts. For to what purpoÅ¿e Å¿hould your PrieÅ¿thoode and Å¿acrifice Å¿erue, Å¿eing ChriÅ¿t his Å¿acrifice hes fulfilled al the types of all the Å¿acrifices of the olde TeÅ¿ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? If you Å¿ay, to Å¿ignifie ChriÅ¿t his Å¿acrifice to come, as theirs did: then that is falÅ¿e, for he is Å¿acrificed already. But if you Å¿ay, to Å¿ignifie and repreÅ¿ent his Å¿acrifice alreadie done: then I Å¿ay, what needes him to be Å¿acrificed againe for that purpoÅ¿e? for the word and Å¿acramentes does repreÅ¿ent him Å¿ufficiently: and Å¿o your MaÅ¿Å¿e needs not to repreÅ¿ent his Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. And if you Å¿ay it repreÅ¿ents his Å¿acrifice: then I Å¿ay, it is not one with that Å¿acrifice of his vpon the croce, whilk you will be loth to graunt, for your Kirk Å¿aith, that it is one with that in Å¿ubÅ¿tance. And I Å¿ay farther,
<note place="margin">Bellar. lib. 1. de MiÅ¿Å¿a, cap. 25</note> if you will Å¿ay with <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine, That this place of the ApoÅ¿t. only excludes abÅ¿olutely the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication of PrieÅ¿ts in the Å¿ame dignitie and power with ChriÅ¿t:</hi> that then they exclude yours alÅ¿o. For if you offer vp the Å¿ame Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice whilk he offered vp, then you haue the Å¿ame power &amp; dignity whilk he had. But this you Å¿ay you doe: for it is no
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:20312:146"/> matter of the difference of the manner, Å¿ince the Å¿acrifice is one. Seing therefore ChriÅ¿t God and man, whilk ye Å¿ay yee offer vp in your MaÅ¿Å¿e is of that Å¿ame dignity, whilk he was of, when he was offered vp vpon the croce: and Å¿eing the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall dignity of the Å¿acrifice makes the equall dignity of the PrieÅ¿t that offers it vp: therefore Å¿acrilegious are your MaÅ¿-PrieÅ¿ts, and excluded heir by the ApoÅ¿tle. And thirdly, I Å¿ay, This is a vaine diÅ¿tinction of yours, of principall and chiefe PrieÅ¿t, and Å¿econdary PrieÅ¿ts: for this is the nature of this Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of ChriÅ¿t that it cannot be offered vp by none, but by himÅ¿elfe. And fourthly, if your MaÅ¿Å¿e-PrieÅ¿ts be but Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ters in this Å¿acrifice, and ChriÅ¿t the principall, (as you Å¿ay) who offers vp himÅ¿elf by you: then I Å¿ay as ye offer vp ChriÅ¿t as inÅ¿truments, for your Å¿innes and the Å¿innes of the people: it Å¿hould followe that ChriÅ¿t offers vp himÅ¿elf in your MaÅ¿Å¿e by you, for his owne Å¿innes, and the Å¿innes of the people: But this is blaÅ¿phemie,
<note place="margin">Heb. 7.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>7.</note> and expreÅ¿ly gainÅ¿aide by the Scripture. And laÅ¿t of all, I Å¿ay, Å¿eing (as your Kirk Å¿ayes) ChriÅ¿t his Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice in the MaÅ¿Å¿e is one with that Å¿acrifice vpon the croce: therefore as ChriÅ¿t offered himÅ¿elf vpon the croce, without the miniÅ¿tery of Å¿econdary PrieÅ¿ts, Å¿o Å¿huld he be offered vp in your MaÅ¿Å¿e, without the miniÅ¿trie of the Å¿ame, or elÅ¿e it is not one with that. So your MaÅ¿Å¿e-PrieÅ¿ts are no waies to be called Å¿econdary PrieÅ¿ts to ChriÅ¿t, except in that reÅ¿pect that <hi>Iudas,</hi> with the band of men of warre and hie-prieÅ¿ts, were the inÅ¿truments and miniÅ¿ters of ChriÅ¿t his taking, death, &amp; crucifying: euen Å¿o you are the inÅ¿truments and miniÅ¿ters of the crucifying of ChriÅ¿t daylie in your MaÅ¿Å¿e, Å¿o far as in you lyes: and in this reÅ¿pect brook ye your Å¿tile of MaÅ¿Å¿e-PrieÅ¿ts. And becauÅ¿e they haue a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mon diÅ¿tinction in their mouths of a bloody and an vn-bloody Å¿acrifice: for they affirme that Å¿acrifice of ChriÅ¿t vpon the croce to be bloody, and that Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of him in the MaÅ¿Å¿e to be vn-bloody: Therefore I will take away this refuge &amp; vaine Å¿tarting hole from them. And firÅ¿t I Å¿ay, this diÅ¿tinction of theirs of a bloody, &amp; vn-bloody Å¿acrifice of the Å¿elf Å¿ame thing that is Å¿acrificed, wants al war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        </gap>nd in the worde of God. For there is not Å¿o meikle in the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:20312:146"/> whole new TeÅ¿tament as a Å¿illabe, that telles vs that there is a proper Å¿acrifice of ChriÅ¿t whilk is vn-bloody: and you ar neuer able to bring one inÅ¿tance to the contrary. Secondly, I Å¿ay, it is repugnant to the Scripture:
<note place="margin">Heb. 10.10.11 12.14. Heb 9.24.25.</note> for the * Scripture on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledges Å¿ik a Å¿acrifice of ChriÅ¿t as is ioyned with his death, as hes bene proued before. See <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24.25. <hi>Not that he Å¿hould offer himÅ¿elf often, for then Å¿hould he haue Å¿uffered often Å¿ince the beginning of the world.</hi> Now if the ApoÅ¿tle his argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t be true, that ChriÅ¿t cannot be offered vp often, becauÅ¿e then he muÅ¿t die often: then this doctrine of yours is againÅ¿t the Å¿cripture, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Å¿ayes, ChriÅ¿t may be offered vp often, and yet not die often. But if you wil Å¿ay, this is Å¿poken of that bloody Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice: I graunt that: and I Å¿ay the ApoÅ¿tle knewe not, nor neuer Å¿pak of another Å¿acrifice: and therefore your doctrine is vaine, that would haue another Å¿acrifice, then euer the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿tles in the whole Scripture hes made mention of. And I Å¿ay thirdly, this diÅ¿tinction of yours cannot Å¿tand with your owne doctrine: for if there be a true Å¿acrifice of ChriÅ¿t pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly in your MaÅ¿Å¿e, as ye Å¿ay, then his blood muÅ¿t be truely Å¿hed, and he muÅ¿t truelie die, (for this is the nature of all Å¿ik Å¿acrifices for Å¿inne, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> graunts it) <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de MiÅ¿Å¿a, fol.</hi> 725. Å¿aying, <hi>If there bee not a true and reall Å¿laughter of ChriÅ¿t in the MaÅ¿Å¿e, then is not the MaÅ¿Å¿e a true and reall Å¿acrifice:</hi> And alÅ¿o, <hi>In all true, real, and externall Å¿acrifices, the Å¿acrifice muÅ¿t be a thing Å¿enÅ¿ible and muÅ¿t be made holy of a prophane thing,</hi> as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confeÅ¿Å¿es: &amp; theÅ¿e conditions he requires in the definition of the Å¿ame: but this, I hope, ye will not Å¿ay of ChriÅ¿t: for he is holye al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, and is inÅ¿enÅ¿ible in your Å¿acrifice, &amp; cannot be Å¿laine againe: therefore properly there can be no true Å¿acrifice of ChriÅ¿t in your MaÅ¿Å¿e, by your owne doctrine. To conclude this then: For theÅ¿e cauÅ¿es wee reiect this abhomination of your MaÅ¿Å¿e. FirÅ¿t, becauÅ¿e ChriÅ¿t cannot be offered vp in a Å¿acrifice, but he muÅ¿t die alÅ¿o, as hes bene prooued, and the Scripture teÅ¿tifies that he hes once died, and all chriÅ¿tians confeÅ¿Å¿es it. Secondly, becauÅ¿e the death of ChriÅ¿t is a Å¿uffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Å¿atisfaction for our Å¿innes, and Å¿o we neede not that he Å¿hould be offered vp againe to Å¿atisfie for the Å¿ame. Thirdly,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:20312:147"/> becauÅ¿e the Å¿pirit of ChriÅ¿t and faith, by the outward means of the word &amp; Å¿acraments &amp; cenÅ¿ures, is a Å¿ufficient meane to apply him to vs, and Å¿o wee neede not the Å¿acrifice of the MaÅ¿Å¿e for that end. Fourthlye, becauÅ¿e ChriÅ¿t onely is the PrieÅ¿t of the new TeÅ¿tament, who hes no Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ors, &amp; whoÅ¿e PrieÅ¿thood cannot paÅ¿Å¿e from one to another, becauÅ¿e he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues for euermore, and he only can be Å¿acrificed by himÅ¿elf, &amp; therfore he only can offer vp himÅ¿elf, whilk he hes once done vpon the croce. Fifthly, becauÅ¿e the Å¿acrifice of ChriÅ¿t vpon the croce is perfite, and the vertue of it indures for euer, and it cannot, nor Å¿hould not be reiterate. Sextly, becauÅ¿e the Scripture propones ChriÅ¿t now Å¿itting in glorie at the right hand of his MaieÅ¿ty, and not vnder the formes of bread and wine in your Å¿acrifice. And Å¿eauenthly, becauÅ¿e it is but the deuiÅ¿e of man, wanting God to beare witneÅ¿Å¿e to it in the Scripture, repugnant to that only one Å¿acrifice of his vppon the croce, aboliÅ¿hing the frutes of his death and paÅ¿sion, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Å¿acrament of the Supper, in abhominable idolatrie, cauÅ¿ing men to worÅ¿hip a bit of bread, as the Å¿onne of God: and laÅ¿t, becauÅ¿e it Å¿poiles men of the fruite of the Å¿acrament Therefore in all theÅ¿e reÅ¿pects it is abhominable, to be dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ted, and in no Å¿ort to be communicated with.</p>

<note place="margin">The degrees of this change and corruption</note> And from the offerings of the people whilk was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, they paÅ¿Å¿e to an oblation whilk was offered: for a Å¿acra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of praiÅ¿e, to a Å¿acrament whilk the PrieÅ¿t conÅ¿umeth all himÅ¿elfe: from a Å¿acrament to confirme vs of our Å¿aluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in ChriÅ¿t, to a propitiatorie Å¿acrifice of the Å¿onne of God, for the redemption of Å¿oules: and from a commemoration of the death of ChriÅ¿t in the Å¿acrament, to a reall immola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and offering of him vp againe, and that not for the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing only, but for the dead alÅ¿o.</p>
                  <p>By theÅ¿e degrees then hes this monÅ¿trous Å¿acrifice beene conceaued formed, receaued life, and brought forth into the world.

<note place="margin">3.

And certainlye were not this, Satan could not haue preuailed Å¿o meikle, in cauÅ¿ing this poiÅ¿on of this monÅ¿trous Å¿acrifice to be Å¿o vniuerÅ¿ally drunken out by the people. For if they had vnderÅ¿tood the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>guage, theÅ¿e words whilk they daily heard in their Å¿eruice, <hi>SurÅ¿um corda, LiÅ¿t vp your heartes: And Å¿hew forth the death of the Å¿onne of man, and confeÅ¿Å¿e his ReÅ¿ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection till his comming.</hi> TheÅ¿e wordes might eaÅ¿ily haue kept them in this knowledge, that ChriÅ¿t was aboue, and they Å¿hould not Å¿eeke him bodily in the Å¿acrament, becauÅ¿e hee was not there really preÅ¿ent, but was to come: and that the Å¿acrament was not a reall offering of the Å¿onne of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, but a Å¿howing foorth of his death, vntill his Å¿econde comming.</p>
                  <p>But two doctrines eÅ¿pecially, whilk by proceÅ¿Å¿e of time
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:20312:155"/> alÅ¿o entered in the Kirk of God,
<note place="margin">4. The doctrine of TranÅ¿ubÅ¿tantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp; Purgatorie brought her to her full perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Å¿trength.</note> brought this pretended Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of their MaÅ¿Å¿e, to her full perfection and Å¿trength: the one was the doctrine of <hi>TranÅ¿ubÅ¿tantiation,</hi> that the bread and wine in the Å¿acrament, by the words Å¿poken, or rather mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by the PrieÅ¿t, was changed in the body and bloode of ChriÅ¿t. From time this was taught the people, then what followed but all adoration and worÅ¿hip to bee giuen to the Å¿acrament, where ChriÅ¿t is really preÅ¿ent. Then how coulde it be but a propitiatory Å¿acrifice for the Å¿innes of the liuing, Å¿eing it was that Å¿elf Å¿ame body and blood, vnder the formes of bread and wine, whilk was offered vp vpon the Croce for the Å¿innes of the worlde. The next was that of <hi>Purgatorie,</hi> for Å¿eing (Å¿ay they) that there is a fire of Purgatory after this life, where through men muÅ¿t paÅ¿Å¿e to heauen: and Å¿eeing in theÅ¿e flames their Å¿innes muÅ¿t be purged: therefore a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die muÅ¿t be fore-Å¿eene: and where is there a remedy to bee found, but in the Å¿acrifice of the MaÅ¿Å¿e, where the Å¿on of God is offered vp, that will releeue our Å¿oules after we are depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? TheÅ¿e will helpe the Å¿oules of our Parents and friends that are there alreadie. Vppon the whilk was founded the MaÅ¿Å¿es and Å¿acrifices for the deade: and from thence came the moÅ¿t part of the donation of lands to the Kirks, to haue MaÅ¿Å¿es Å¿aide for their Å¿oules.</p>
                  <p>So then, to conclude, the loÅ¿Å¿e of the communion in the Å¿acrament of the Supper,
<note place="margin">The concluÅ¿ion</note> next the Å¿anctification of the obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the people, whilk at laÅ¿te was turned to that whilk the PrieÅ¿te conÅ¿umed himÅ¿elfe alone: thirdly, the aua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice of the PrieÅ¿tes whilk bred their damnable doctrine, that the Supper was not only a Å¿acrament, but a Å¿acrifice, &amp;c fourthly, the applying of the praiers conceaued of the giftes of the people, vnto the rounde hoÅ¿t and Challice, whilk the PrieÅ¿t conÅ¿umed: fifthly, the abuÅ¿ing of the word Å¿acrifice, whilk the fathers and Kirk vÅ¿ed: Å¿extly, the publick and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerÅ¿all negligence and ignorance of PaÅ¿tor and people: Å¿eauenthly, the confuÅ¿ion of languages: and laÅ¿t of all, their damnable doctrine of TranÅ¿ubÅ¿tantiation and Purgatorie: TheÅ¿e were the degrees by the whilk their abhominable Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice

And Å¿eeing praier is a honor only due to God, and IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t is our only Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator and interceÅ¿Å¿or: therefore this praier to Saints depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted is both idolatrous, and iniurious to ChriÅ¿t his interceÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and mediation.

                     <p>The third abuÅ¿e, is the abÅ¿olution pronounced to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders of the MaÅ¿Å¿e: <hi>Amen, Brethren and Å¿iÅ¿ters by the mercy of our Lord IeÅ¿us, by the helpe and Å¿igne of the Croce, by the interceÅ¿sion of the Virgine Marie, by the merites of the ApoÅ¿tles, and of all the hee Saints, and Å¿hee Saints, God giue you mercie.</hi> FirÅ¿t, this aggrees not with their priuate MaÅ¿Å¿es, where the PrieÅ¿t and the Clark only are preÅ¿ent: for how can the PrieÅ¿t Å¿peake truly, <hi>Amen brethren and Å¿iÅ¿ters,</hi> Å¿ince none is preÅ¿ent but the Clark onely. Next, that whilk is only proper to IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, to his death, merites, and interceÅ¿sion, to make the Father merciful vnto vs, and to make him to forgiue vs our Å¿innes, is taken from him heir, and communicate vnto the virgine <hi>Marie,</hi> and the
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:20312:158"/> merites of al the hee Saints &amp; Å¿he Saints: and whilk is moÅ¿t horrible, vnto the Å¿igne of the Croce: that by her interceÅ¿si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, their merites, and the help of the Å¿igne of the Croce, God might haue mercy. What horrible idolatry is this, to ioyne Å¿ik helpers to the Å¿onne of God, who is a perfite Sauiour. To ioyne the merites of fleÅ¿h and blood, to his merites, as thogh his were not Å¿ufficient to obtaine Å¿aluation. And as though men were not only able to merite eternal life to themÅ¿elues but alÅ¿o had Å¿ik aboundance of merites that they Å¿erued to obtaine mercie for others: and Å¿o not only to make them Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours of themÅ¿elues, but of others alÅ¿o. And that whilk is yet more horrible idolatry and blaÅ¿phemy, (if worÅ¿e can be) to ioyne with him the helpe of the Å¿igne of the Croce. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in their Breuiarie they Å¿ay, <hi>Keepe vs Lorde with thy peace, &amp;c. whome thou haÅ¿t redeemed by the tree of thy holy Croce.</hi> And in a hymne, <hi>O Croce, haile O Croce, only hope, increaÅ¿e, righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e to the godlie, and forgiue the guiltie.</hi> And in their breuiarie they Å¿ay, <hi>We adore thy Croce Ã´ Lord.</hi> Now what is it to mock God, if this be not: to Å¿ubÅ¿titute creatures, yea a very Å¿tock and a tree in the roome of the Å¿onne of God, and to aÅ¿criue rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vnto it: and to pray for righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e and remiÅ¿sion at the Å¿ame, to adore it, and to call it their onely eÅ¿perance?

And being vrged againe, how he durÅ¿t commit Å¿o horrible a wickedneÅ¿Å¿e, as to giue Å¿o great an occaÅ¿ion of Å¿o horrible idolatrie to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: who kneeling on their knees, caÅ¿ting themÅ¿elf on the earth, lifting vp their hands towards the altar, Å¿triking their breaÅ¿tes, did worÅ¿hip the vn-conÅ¿ecrated bread and cupe. Vnto whome he anÅ¿wered, that it was not Å¿o great a fault as hee Å¿aide of it: and that hee was not allone, but many moe did the Å¿ame, whilk thought it not Å¿o abhominable an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, as he made of it. TheÅ¿e two hiÅ¿tories I finde written by a SpaniÅ¿he authour, one <hi>Cyprian Valera,</hi> the title whereof is, Of the Pope and his authority, &amp; of the MaÅ¿Å¿e &amp; the holines thereof. All theÅ¿e than that heard the MaÅ¿Å¿es of theÅ¿e men, and adored the Å¿acrament whilk they lifted vp, committed idolatrie by their owne Canons and decrees: for the laÅ¿t did not pronounce the words of conÅ¿ecration, &amp; the other foure had not the intent to conÅ¿ecrate: and therefore there was no TranÅ¿ubÅ¿tantiation there, by their owne doctrine, &amp; Å¿o they worÅ¿hipped bread and wine as their great redeemer &amp; cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator. But what a miÅ¿erable religion is this, that depends vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the intention of another: and therefore who can be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, by their owne doctrine, whether it be God they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip or not in their Å¿acrament. And this made a certaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiÅ¿itor, an enemy to the trueth, fearing when hee heard MaÅ¿Å¿e, whether the PrieÅ¿t had intention to conÅ¿ecrate or not to Å¿ay, O Lord, if thou be there I adore thee: and Å¿o by this Å¿ubtelty he thought to eÅ¿cape committing of idolatry. In the time of the Councell of <hi>ConÅ¿tance,</hi> there was three Popes that the Councell for their abhominations did depoÅ¿e, &amp; elected another: theÅ¿e three not beeing Popes coulde not ordaine PrieÅ¿ts, nor giue them authority to conÅ¿ecrate: Å¿o that by their owne Canons, all they that heard MaÅ¿Å¿es of Å¿ik PrieÅ¿tes
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:20312:162"/> as had their authority from them, committed idolatry. This Å¿ame may be Å¿aide of them that heard the MaÅ¿Å¿es of all theÅ¿e PrieÅ¿tes that were ordained by Pope <hi>ConÅ¿tantine</hi> the firÅ¿t, and the whoore Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the 8. For neither of theÅ¿e had power to ordaine PrieÅ¿tes by their owne Canons. And as for Pope <hi>Iohn,</hi> there is no controuerÅ¿ie of it, becauÅ¿e Å¿he was a woman, not capable of that authority by their owne Canons. And as for <hi>ConÅ¿tantine</hi> the firÅ¿t, he was a laick man, who without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing any orders was by force named Pope. He not being a PrieÅ¿t himÅ¿elf, could not giue this authority to others. And Å¿o by their owne doctrine, all theÅ¿e that heard the MaÅ¿Å¿es of Å¿ik PrieÅ¿ts did commit horrible idolatry. And howÅ¿oeuer the Pope and his Cleargie affirmes it to be God, and not bread and wine, whilk they adore; yet ye Å¿hall Å¿ee what eÅ¿timation they haue themÅ¿elues of that breaden God of theirs, by Å¿ome examples. Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the Å¿eauenth, vÅ¿ed it for coniuratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, and Å¿ought a reÅ¿ponÅ¿e of it, and becauÅ¿e it woulde giue him none, he caÅ¿te it in the fire, and burned it, and Å¿o burned his Creator. They vÅ¿e it to reuenge their wrongs, hatred and malice by it: and therfore Pope <hi>Victor</hi> the third in the yeare. 1088. was poiÅ¿oned in the Challice by his Å¿ub-deacon.

And the FranciÅ¿cans <hi>de alia Villa</hi> burnt the Cow whilk had eaten vp the Å¿acrament out of the PrieÅ¿tes hand, and Å¿o in burning her, did burne their Creator with her. <hi>Molon,</hi> one of the SpaniÅ¿h inquiÅ¿ition, 35. yeeres Å¿ince, being to goe into proceÅ¿sion vpon the day of <hi>Corpus ChriÅ¿ti,</hi> &amp; the hoÅ¿te that was to be put in the boxe, beeing Å¿o great that it could not be placed in the Å¿ame, he being impatient to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waite whill another hoÅ¿te had bene conÅ¿ecrate, demanded ane paire of Å¿heares, and clipped his God and Creator: and Å¿o went on forewarde to their proceÅ¿sion. Of the whilk we
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:20312:163"/> gather two things. FirÅ¿t, that their Popes and EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿tical rable is without all God and religion, that makes Å¿o light of their God as to clip it and burne it, and vÅ¿e it as the inÅ¿tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their mallice &amp; reuenge. Secondly, that this conÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate bread of theirs whilk they Å¿ell to the people to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hiped and adored is moÅ¿te abhominable Idolatry, whereof one day they Å¿hall giue a reckoning to God: and thus much for the tenth abuÅ¿e of their idolatrous MaÅ¿Å¿e.</p>

Nowe theÅ¿e MaÅ¿Å¿es are Å¿o diuerÅ¿e, that the MaÅ¿Å¿e that is Å¿aide at one of theÅ¿e Å¿olemne times, cannot Å¿erue for another: the MaÅ¿Å¿e for lent, cannot Å¿erue for the time of fleÅ¿he: the MaÅ¿Å¿e for PaÅ¿ch cannot Å¿erue for ChriÅ¿tmaÅ¿Å¿e, and Å¿o forth of the reÅ¿t. In the whilk there are many horrible abuÅ¿es. FirÅ¿t, if the MaÅ¿Å¿e be one with the Supper (as they Å¿ay) then as there is but one Supper of the Lord, whilk is inÅ¿tituted only for the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:20312:166"/> of ChriÅ¿t, whilk is but one in generall for all: &amp; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of all the faithfull are partakers, of whatÅ¿omeuer ranke they be: be they great, be they Å¿mal, be they riche, be they poore; and whilk Å¿erues for all times. For, as our Sauiour did inÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute but one BaptiÅ¿me to Å¿erue for all perÅ¿ons, &amp; for al times Å¿o he did inÅ¿titute but one Supper to Å¿erue for all perÅ¿ons &amp; all times. If therefore the MaÅ¿Å¿e were one with the Supper, it Å¿hould be but one for all perÅ¿ons, and for all Å¿eaÅ¿ons. But this diuerÅ¿itie of MaÅ¿Å¿es does teÅ¿tifie that it is not the inÅ¿titu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, but the inÅ¿titution of AntichriÅ¿t, &amp; that it is not one with the Lord his Supper, as they falÅ¿ly alledge: Yea, it doth teÅ¿tifie that they haue forÅ¿aken the truth of God and are giuen ouer of God to beleeue lies, and to be decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by Å¿trong deluÅ¿ions, that they might be damned.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, what needes Å¿euerall MaÅ¿Å¿es of the Trinity, of the holy Å¿pirit, of the name of IeÅ¿us? for Å¿eeing the three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons of the Trinity are one, &amp; they all concurre in the worke of our faith, the Father giuing his Å¿onne by his holy Å¿pirite in the word and Å¿acraments: therefore this diuerÅ¿ity as thogh the perÅ¿ons of the Trinitie were Å¿eparate, is needleÅ¿Å¿e.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, this woulde be marked: that Å¿uppoÅ¿e they haue Å¿tiled their MaÅ¿Å¿es from Å¿undry perÅ¿ons, yet they haue not aÅ¿criued a Å¿ingulare MaÅ¿Å¿e to IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, that it might bee named Å¿implie the MaÅ¿Å¿e of IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t: and this, no queÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not without the prouidence of God, that Å¿eeing the MaÅ¿Å¿e is not the inÅ¿titution of ChriÅ¿t, but of AntichriÅ¿t; not the ordinance of God, but of Sathan: he would not that Å¿ik a blaÅ¿phemous and idolatrous inuention Å¿houlde haue the Å¿ame Å¿tile to be called the MaÅ¿Å¿e of ChriÅ¿t Å¿implie, without any further addition, as the Supper is called the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.

Either therefore theÅ¿e Å¿entences that are Å¿poken of him are falÅ¿e, or elÅ¿e all MaÅ¿Å¿es Å¿aid for him are Å¿uperfluous. 8. if the MaÅ¿Å¿e be one with the Supper, then as the Supper was only inÅ¿tituted for the liuing, and not for the dead: and therefore our Sauiour in the Supper commands, <hi>To take eate, drinke, and to doe it in remembrance of him,</hi> whilk the dead cannot doe: Å¿o theÅ¿e MaÅ¿Å¿es Å¿hould not be for the dead. And for what dead are theÅ¿e, that theÅ¿e MaÅ¿Å¿es are Å¿aide? If they Å¿ay, for them that are in heauen or hell: I anÅ¿were, the one needes them not, and they are vnprofitable for the other. If they Å¿ay, for them that are in Purgatorie: I anÅ¿were, this Purgatorye is but their owne inuention, to draw water to their owne mil, and to enriche the Popes treaÅ¿ures, for the Scripture makes no mention of it. Ninthly, their MaÅ¿Å¿es that are Å¿aid for them that are abÅ¿ent, as for the PriÅ¿oners, for them that Å¿ailles, &amp; are in their voiage, &amp;c. makes it manifeÅ¿t alÅ¿o, that the MaÅ¿Å¿e is not one with the Lords Supper: for it was inÅ¿tituted not to them that were abÅ¿ent, but to them that were preÅ¿ent. For in the Supper they are commanded to take, eate, and to drinke in remembrance of him, whilk the abÅ¿ent cannot do. Indeede it is true, that theÅ¿e that are preÅ¿ent at the MaÅ¿Å¿e does eate and drinke as little, as they that are abÅ¿ent: the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                     <p>The twentie and one abuÅ¿e, is their mixing of parcels of the Scripture, with their abhomination &amp; idolatries in their MaÅ¿Å¿e, after the manner of thoÅ¿e who goes about to impoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on anie: who mixes their poiÅ¿on with Å¿ome good food, that it may be the leÅ¿Å¿e Å¿uÅ¿pected: or rather as the Magicians &amp; Charmers does, who mixes with their diueliÅ¿h practiÅ¿es, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of the Scriptures of God, and makes thoÅ¿e to Å¿erue for their diueliÅ¿h purpoÅ¿es, whilk was appointed to Gods honor So are all the places of Scripture, whilk are read and Å¿ung in their MaÅ¿Å¿e, they are brought forth, not for the truth, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t the truth for their idolatry and abhomination: &amp; this they haue done, that their idolatry may bee leÅ¿Å¿e Å¿uÅ¿pected by the Å¿imple.

Fourthly, Å¿eing the Scripture whilk is read and Å¿ung in your MaÅ¿Å¿e, is read and Å¿ung in an vnknowne language, as all the reÅ¿t of your MaÅ¿Å¿e is done: to what purpoÅ¿e does it Å¿erue? and what is it but a mocking of God, and abuÅ¿ing of the poore people.</p>

<note place="margin">This title of Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uand of Å¿eruands will not excuÅ¿e him, being indeid the title of cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed Cham, for he is called the Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uand of Å¿eruands and Å¿o fit in the Lords iuÅ¿t proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for your Popes who is that man of Å¿in.</note> if another (Å¿aies he) Å¿hall come in his owne name, him ye will receaue. This no doubt, as AuguÅ¿tine expones the Å¿ame, is meant of the AntichriÅ¿t, that the Iewes Å¿hall receaue. Nowe it is out of all controuerÅ¿ie that the Iewes neuer receaued the Pope: Therefore the Pope is not the AntichriÅ¿t. Againe, the Pope came neuer in his owne name but in the name of ChriÅ¿t, for he is called the Vicare of ChriÅ¿t, and the Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uand of the Å¿eruands of God: therefore he cannot be the AntichriÅ¿t.</p>

But nowe I minde to doe it (God willing) after that I haue anÅ¿wered to your arguments. Your firÅ¿t reaÅ¿on is, The Iewes Å¿hall receaue the AntichriÅ¿t: but they neuer receaued the Pope: therefore the Pope is not the AntichriÅ¿t. I anÅ¿wer: Your PropoÅ¿ition I deny, that the Iewes Å¿hall receaue the AntichriÅ¿t. For firÅ¿t I will aske you, Are you of that opinion with <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> the RhemiÅ¿ts, and the reÅ¿t of your Cleargy,
<note place="margin">Bella 1. lib. 3. de Rom. Pont. cap. 12.. RhemiÅ¿t. annot. vpon 2 TheÅ¿. 2 The Iewes Å¿huld not receaue the antichriÅ¿t as their MeÅ¿sias.</note> that they Å¿hall receaue him as their <hi>MeÅ¿sias,</hi> whilk they looke for? If you be not of their minde, then beÅ¿ide that you diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent from the doctrine of your owne Kirk, it is not probable that the Iewes woulde receaue him, if they thought not hee were their MeÅ¿sias. And if ye be of their minde, then I Å¿ay, the Iewes will receaue none as their <hi>MeÅ¿sias,</hi> but theÅ¿e who are borne of the tribe of <hi>Iuda,</hi> and the family of <hi>Dauid</hi> in <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem,</hi> and who Å¿hall reigne in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem.</hi> But the tribes are confounded, Å¿o that they cannot knowe it, and the family of <hi>Dauid</hi> deÅ¿troyed by Å¿undry Emperours: or at the leaÅ¿t, Å¿o co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>

And Å¿o (if this be true) the AntichriÅ¿t whilk ye imagine heir will neuer come, Å¿ince your AntichriÅ¿t and their <hi>MeÅ¿sias</hi> that they looke for, are both one, as your Kirk Å¿uppones. And I Å¿ay further, <hi>Sanderus</hi> and the RhemiÅ¿ts Å¿ayes,
<note place="margin">In 8. demonÅ¿t. RhemiÅ¿t. annot. v<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pon the 2, TheÅ¿Å¿a</note> the AntichriÅ¿t Å¿hall come of the tribe of <hi>Dan:</hi> if then he Å¿hall come of the tribe of <hi>Dan,</hi> (as they Å¿ay) the Iewes will neuer receaue him as their MeÅ¿sias, becauÅ¿e they know their MeÅ¿sias whilk they looke for, Å¿hall come of the tribe of Iuda.

Thirdlye, I lay this ground whilk you cannot deny, that the Iewes <hi>are to be planted in again in the naturall Oliue:</hi> that is, they are to be conuerted to ChriÅ¿t, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e <hi>their fall was but for a time,</hi> as the ApoÅ¿tle plainly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telles,
<note place="margin">Rom. 11. RhemiÅ¿t annot. v<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pon that chapter</note> and the RhemiÅ¿tes graunts it. Vpon the whilk I aske you, MaiÅ¿ter <hi>Gilbert,</hi> whether Å¿hall they receaue the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriÅ¿t, before, or after their conuerÅ¿ion? If you Å¿ay, after: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> I Å¿ay, after they haue embraced the true MeÅ¿sias &amp; the GoÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, how can it be that they will looke for another MeÅ¿sias, and receaue the AntichriÅ¿t as their Sauiour. Next, we read of their conuerÅ¿ion in the Scripture, but nothing of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection of ChriÅ¿t after their conuerÅ¿ion. And thirdly, Å¿eeing (as your Kirk Å¿ayes) the AntichriÅ¿t Å¿halbe Å¿ent to them, and they Å¿hal receaue him, becauÅ¿e they receaued not ChriÅ¿t Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿us: of force then it cannot be after their conuerÅ¿ion. For the cauÅ¿e, to wit, their hardneÅ¿Å¿e of heart, and refuÅ¿all of the true MeÅ¿sias, being taken away: this puniÅ¿hment Å¿hould not bee Å¿ent vnto them after their embracing of ChriÅ¿t: Å¿o not after their conuerÅ¿ion.

Or elÅ¿e what likelihoode is there that euer they Å¿hall be conuerted to ChriÅ¿t, whilk is againÅ¿t both the Scripture, &amp; your owne doctrine? for Å¿eing the Iewes are to receiue him as their MeÅ¿sias, &amp; Å¿eing he is to builde their Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ple, reÅ¿tore their ceremonies, &amp; obtain y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie of the whole world, eÅ¿pecially by their help (as your doctrine affirmes) Å¿hall not this driue them further from ChriÅ¿t,
<note place="margin">Bella 1. lib. 3. de Rom. Pont. cap. 12.16. &amp;c.</note> and harden their harts more then euer it was before? And Å¿eing he Å¿hall raigne but three yeares and a halfe, and they cannot embrace the true Sauiour, as long as he raignes (for they cannot embrace both the AntichriÅ¿t, and the true ChriÅ¿t together) and Å¿eeing after his death the day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:20312:172"/> Å¿hall come immediatly, or at the leaÅ¿t 45. dayes after, (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> Å¿ayes:) how can it be poÅ¿sible that they Å¿hal e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be turned to ChriÅ¿t before the end of the worlde, if this your doctrine be true? Therefore they cannot receaue the AntichriÅ¿t before their conuerÅ¿ion, and Å¿o they Å¿hall neuer receaue the AntichriÅ¿t. So then to conclude this point, as the <hi>MeÅ¿sias</hi> whilk the poore blinded Iewes lookes for, will neuer come, the true <hi>MeÅ¿sias</hi> being come already, whome they cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified: So the AntichriÅ¿t whilk ye imagine will neuer come, for the true AntichriÅ¿t (whilk either ye will not Å¿ee, or elÅ¿e if ye Å¿ee, ye will not confeÅ¿Å¿e him) lurkes within your owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ome, theÅ¿e many yeares, whome ye labour to couer, that he Å¿hould not be Å¿eene.</p>
                  <p>But how proue ye that the Iewes will receaue the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriÅ¿t? BecauÅ¿e our Sauiour Å¿ayes to the Iewes, <hi>If another Å¿hal come in his owne name, him ye will receaue.</hi> I graunt indeede our Sauiour Å¿o Å¿peakes. But firÅ¿te I Å¿ay, this <hi>other</hi> is not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tricted to the AntichriÅ¿t only,
<note place="margin">IoÅ¿eph. de bello Iudaico, lib. 2. ca. 12. Pet. Gala. lib. 40. cap. 21. Bellarm lib. 3. de Rom. Pont. c. 12.</note> but to be referred to all falÅ¿e Prophets, who Å¿hall come, not being Å¿ent of God, Å¿o <hi>Nonus,</hi> Å¿o <hi>Lyra</hi> expones it: and this was fulfilled long Å¿ince in recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of <hi>Theudas</hi> and <hi>Cozban,</hi> and other deceauers whom they receaued. As for <hi>AuguÅ¿tine,</hi> it is true, he expones it of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriÅ¿t. But if <hi>Bellarmine</hi> reiects <hi>AuguÅ¿tins</hi> opinion concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the generation of the AntichriÅ¿t, that he Å¿hall come of the tribe of <hi>Dan,</hi> becauÅ¿e <hi>it cannot</hi> (Å¿aies he) <hi>bee prooued by the Scripture:</hi> Å¿hall it not alÅ¿o be lawfull for vs, not to be bound to the expoÅ¿ition of <hi>AuguÅ¿tine,</hi> vnleÅ¿Å¿e it be certain by the Å¿crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Å¿o giue vs that libertye whilk yee take to your Å¿elues. Your firÅ¿t reaÅ¿on then hes no feete: for this place Å¿peakes of all falÅ¿e Prophets whatÅ¿omeuer, whilk the Iewes Å¿hould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue: and it hes bene accompliÅ¿hed Å¿undry times amongÅ¿t them: therfore this yet remaines vnprooued that the Iewes Å¿hall receaue the AntichriÅ¿t. This for the firÅ¿t part of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. The Å¿econd part of your argument is, <hi>The Pope came neuer in his owne name, but in the name of ChriÅ¿t:</hi> therefore hee is not the AntichriÅ¿t. Your antecedent I deny. For if ye will credite <hi>FranciÅ¿cus Toledo</hi> if ye knowe him, writing vppon the
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:20312:173"/> Å¿ame place, he Å¿ayes, <hi>He Å¿hall come in his owne name, who truely Å¿hall haue no diuine vertue,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Pope come not in the name of ChriÅ¿t in truth but in his owne name, becauÅ¿e ChriÅ¿t left him neuer in his Å¿tead or left na Å¿ik cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in his worde.</note> 
                     <hi>but Å¿hall faine himÅ¿elf to be Å¿ent of God, as the falÅ¿e Prophets came in their owne name, becauÅ¿e they were not tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Å¿ent of God. And this is that,</hi> Å¿aies he, <hi>whilk is Å¿aid now</hi> (meaning in this place) <hi>if only Å¿hall come in his owne name: that he, is not tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Å¿ent of God, neither hes Gods power.</hi> So then a falÅ¿e Prophete is Å¿aide both to come in the name of God, and in his owne name: in the name of God falÅ¿lye vanting Å¿o: in his owne name, becauÅ¿e God Å¿ends him not, but he intrudes himÅ¿elfe without a lawfull calling. Nowe to anÅ¿were you then, I Å¿ay the Pope comes in the name of ChriÅ¿t, as his Vicare, I grant he and his Cleargie Å¿o vaunts: but falÅ¿ly. For the truth is, he hes come, and he commes in his owne name, and that truly, becauÅ¿e the Lord neuer Å¿ent him, but he hes intruded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elfe without God his calling: therefore this can not free him but he may be the AntichriÅ¿t. But howe proue ye that hee commes in ChriÅ¿t his name, and not in his owne name? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e (Å¿ay ye) he calles himÅ¿elf the Vicare of ChriÅ¿t, and the Å¿eruand of the Å¿eruands of God. A pretty argument: hee Å¿o calles himÅ¿elf, <hi>Ergo</hi> he is Å¿o.

So if this argument of yours will follow, The Pope is called the Vicare of ChriÅ¿t, &amp; the Å¿eruand of the Å¿eruands of God, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee came neuer in his owne name, and Å¿o hee is not the AntichriÅ¿t: you may with as good reaÅ¿on conclude, that the falÅ¿e Prophetes and falÅ¿e ApoÅ¿tles, came not in their owne name, but in the name of God, becauÅ¿e they are called the Å¿eruands of God, both by themÅ¿elues, and alÅ¿o by theÅ¿e who were deceaued by them. Yea, you may with as good reaÅ¿on conclude, that the AntichriÅ¿t is not the Å¿onne of perdition, &amp; aduerÅ¿ary to God, and that all the kingdomes of the worlde are giuen to the Diuell, &amp; that he hes the power in his hand of giuing them to whom he will: becauÅ¿e the Scripture fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolde of the one, that he Å¿hould haue hornes like the Lambe,
<note place="margin">2. TheÅ¿Å¿al, 2. &amp; Reuel. 17 Matth 4.</note> and the other aÅ¿criues this right and power to himÅ¿elfe. It is good therefore that you cannot defend your Pope from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the AntichriÅ¿t, vnleÅ¿Å¿e with him alÅ¿o you defend all the falÅ¿e Prophets, falÅ¿e ApoÅ¿tles, falÅ¿e Kirks, the AntichriÅ¿t, and the Diuell himÅ¿elfe, from being the thing whilk they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede.

You Å¿ay he is the Vicare of ChriÅ¿t, but ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us in his latter TeÅ¿ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, did neuer leaue him to be in his Å¿tead.

And becauÅ¿e you Å¿ay he is the Å¿eruand or Å¿eruands: what Å¿eruice, I pray you, does he wherby he makes it manifeÅ¿t that he is a Å¿eruand in deede? For the principall Å¿eruice of the miniÅ¿try of the Kirk Å¿tands in preaching the word, whilk he neither does, neither thinks that it appertaines to him to doe. Yea, what is it that appertaines to ony Lord, King, or Monarch in the earth, that he aÅ¿criues not to himÅ¿elfe, and does not alÅ¿o practiÅ¿e? Yea, as though that were too little, what either Å¿tile or properties or workes, whilk are peculiar only to God his MaieÅ¿ty, that he aÅ¿criues not to himÅ¿elfe, as (God willing) Å¿halbe prooued afterward in the third mark of the AntichriÅ¿t.

                     <hi>He who is the Å¿eruand of Å¿eruands is the lord of Lords, and he deÅ¿ires to be as though he were God: hee Å¿peakes great things as if he were God: he changeth the lawes, eÅ¿tabliÅ¿heth his owne:

                     <p>Your Å¿econd reaÅ¿on is, the AntichriÅ¿t is but one Å¿ingular perÅ¿on. The Popes hes bene many: therefore they are not the AntichriÅ¿t. I deny your propoÅ¿ition, for there lyes all the
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:20312:175"/> controuerÅ¿ie. We Å¿ay the AntichriÅ¿t is not this Pope, or that Pope an certaine perÅ¿on. But wee aÅ¿criue this name, to the whole Å¿eate and the Å¿ucceÅ¿sion of your Popes: we Å¿ay the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and the kingdome of your Romaine Kirk, whereof your Popes are the heades, is that AntichriÅ¿t whilk was to come. So if you proue that the AntichriÅ¿t Å¿hould be but a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perÅ¿on, and not a body, a kingdome, a Å¿eate and Å¿ucceÅ¿si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of men that are aduerÅ¿aries to God and to IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, I will graunt you haue Å¿ufficientlie cleared your Pope from beeing AntichriÅ¿t. But content your Å¿elfe (MaiÅ¿ter <hi>Gilbert:</hi>) this ye will neuer proue by the Scripture: and therefore ye muÅ¿t let your Popes be accounted the AntichriÅ¿t Å¿till. And if this reaÅ¿on of yours be good, the AntichriÅ¿t is one certaine perÅ¿on. Therefore the Popes, becauÅ¿e they are many, are not the AntichriÅ¿t; wherefore (I pray you) Å¿hall not this alÅ¿o be good: the Vicare of ChriÅ¿t is one certaine man, but the Popes are many: therefore they are not ChriÅ¿t his Vicare? What difference (I pray you) is there beetwene the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? And if ye will Å¿ay, the Vicare of ChriÅ¿t is not one Å¿ingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar man, but a Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ion of many in one office: why will ye not alÅ¿o graunt, that the AntichriÅ¿t is not a Å¿ingular man, but the Å¿ucceÅ¿sion of many in the Å¿elfe Å¿ame impietie. So either chooÅ¿e you, whether will ye graunt that the AntichriÅ¿t is not one Å¿ingular man, but a Å¿ucceÅ¿sion of many; or elÅ¿e that the Popes are not ChriÅ¿t his Vicare: for the one ye muÅ¿t doe, if this reaÅ¿on of yours holde forth. But how doe ye proue that the AntichriÅ¿t is but one Å¿ingular perÅ¿on? You Å¿ay, that Saint <hi>Paule</hi> telles that he Å¿halbe but one. Howe woulde yee haue cried out, if I had fathered Å¿ik a falÅ¿et vpon the Å¿pirit of God as you do heir? but let Å¿ik be far from mee. You Å¿ay, Saint <hi>Paule</hi> calles him the Å¿onne of perdition, and puts him in the Å¿ingular nomber: therefore Å¿ay ye, the AntichriÅ¿t Å¿halbe but one Å¿ingular perÅ¿on.

So what warrand haue ye to gather that heir, whilk you dare not gather out of the like phraÅ¿es of the Scripture?

This rock vpon the whilk ChriÅ¿t promiÅ¿ed to builde his Kirk, is but one Å¿ingular perÅ¿on, becauÅ¿e our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our puts him in the Å¿ingular nomber <hi>(Epi taute te petra)</hi> Vpon this rocke: but your Popes of Rome are not one Å¿ingulare perÅ¿on, but many: Therefore your Popes of Rome are not this Rock vpon the whilk ChriÅ¿t promiÅ¿ed to builde his Kirk What difference is there betweene your argument for the Pope, and this argument againÅ¿t the Pope, Å¿eeing both are grounded vpon the like phraÅ¿e? ChooÅ¿e you then, MaiÅ¿ter <hi>Gilbert,</hi> whether will you haue the AntichriÅ¿t, not to be one Å¿ingular perÅ¿on, but a Å¿ucceÅ¿sion of many: or will you haue the Popes not to be the rockes where upon the Kirk is buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded? for the one ye muÅ¿t.

So this doctrine of yours, that the AntichriÅ¿t Å¿halbe but one Å¿ingular perÅ¿on, can neither Å¿tand with the Å¿cripture, nor yet with your owne doctrine concerning the AntichriÅ¿t.

If he will deny this, I cannot tell what any man can Å¿ay to him, but whether God will or not, he will haue the Pope to be the AntichriÅ¿t, albeit it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the word of God.

And as for the third thing, the inuocation of Saints departed, I Å¿ay, this argument is Å¿o far from clearing him from being an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerÅ¿ary to God, that if there were no more, it is ynough to conuict your Popes and your Kirk, that they are aduerÅ¿aries to God.

And hee only Å¿hould be incalled vpon, who knowes our neceÅ¿sities, &amp; is able to heare our praiers, and to graunt them. But only God in ChriÅ¿t, the Å¿earcher of the heart doth theÅ¿e thinges: Therefore he only ought to be incalled vpon.

And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ide many other thinges, I finde this in it: that the AntichriÅ¿t Å¿hould be borne of a Virgine, by the helpe of the Diuell, as ChriÅ¿t was borne of the Virgine by the worke of the holye GhoÅ¿t. I wondered that you Å¿hould haue wiÅ¿hed me to read that booke, in the whilk there was Å¿o manifeÅ¿t an error, and that contrary the doctrine of your own Kirk.

Let vs therefore out of the Scripture Å¿earche the markes of the AntichriÅ¿t, and then let vs Å¿ee whether their Popes of Rome bee Å¿tamped with theÅ¿e markes or not.

<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 4.3.2. TheÅ¿. 2, Apoc 11 13.17.18.</note> whome the places of Scripture noted on the margent, does deÅ¿criue. And while as I affirme, that the Popes of Rome are this great AntichriÅ¿t, I vnderÅ¿tand it thus: that they are the Prince &amp; head of that defection and apoÅ¿taÅ¿ie, whilk the Scripture fore-Å¿hewe and fore-told was to come in the Kirk. For I doe not thinke, that all the Å¿trength and force of the AntichriÅ¿t, is included in the Pope: but the Pope &amp; his kingdome whilk is contrary to the kingdome of ChriÅ¿t, is moÅ¿te truely called the AntichriÅ¿t: whereof, becauÅ¿e the Pope is the Prince and head: therefore by that figure, taking the part for the whole, I call him the AntichriÅ¿t. And in this we followe the Å¿crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: for the Scripture Å¿peaking of the AntichriÅ¿t, Å¿ometime calles it a defection, and a myÅ¿tery of iniquity, and the Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond beaÅ¿t that hes the hornes like the Lambe, and the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lote: and Å¿ometimes points out the principall and chiefe in this kingdome, on whome the whole body of iniquity doeth hang: as when he writes heir, the man of Å¿inne, and Å¿onne of perdition, whilk is an aduerÅ¿ary, who extolles himÅ¿elf aboue all &amp;c. whilk is moÅ¿t properly Å¿poken, not of the bodie, but of the head.

But the doctrine of the Kirk of Rome ranuerÅ¿es this doctrine of our Å¿aluation, and teaches that ChriÅ¿t Å¿uffered not the wrath of God vpon his Å¿oule: whilk if it be true, then ChriÅ¿t hes not paied our debt Å¿ufficiently: for our debt was not onely the naturall death of the bodie, but the wrath of God vpon the Å¿oule:

                     <p>The fifth marke of the AntichriÅ¿t, as he is deÅ¿criued by the ApoÅ¿tle is in theÅ¿e words:

So that it behoued that empire firÅ¿t to be tranÅ¿lated, and peece &amp; peece diminiÅ¿hed before the AntichriÅ¿te coulde come vp to his hight, for that Å¿tayed him.

So then it behooued the empire to tranÅ¿late his Å¿eat from Rome, that Rome whilk was firÅ¿t the Å¿eat of the empire, might be the Å¿eate of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriÅ¿t.

And peece and peece that empire of the Greeke Emperour began to decay. And was tranÅ¿la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Greekes to the French-men by the Popes: and then from them to the Germanes, by the Popes alÅ¿o.

So that nowe he vaunts himÅ¿elfe to be Monarch of the whole worlde, and all Kings and Princes gaue him their oath of allengeance: &amp; the Emperours and Kings held their empires and kingdoms of him, and are but his vaÅ¿Å¿als. (as their Canon Lawe Å¿aies) So that by the taking away of the Roman empire, the Popes did then climbe vp to their Å¿upremacie, &amp; make themÅ¿elues manifeÅ¿t, that they were the AntichriÅ¿t. And Å¿o this doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿o aggree to the Pope of Rome, and to none other.

For as in the Romane impire, there was an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour whome all did worÅ¿hip as God: vnto whome there was ioyned a Senate, who was next in authority to him: Å¿o is the frame of the gouernement of the PapiÅ¿tical kingdome There is a Monarch the Pope; whome all are compelled, when they come in his Å¿ight, to worÅ¿hip as an earthly God, to whoÅ¿e Å¿entence al muÅ¿t Å¿tand to, who iudgeth all, but can be iudged of none, who hes ioined with him a Senate of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, who are next him in authority.

Thirdly, as in Rome was the heade of the empire, the Emperour and his Senate with him, and as the Emperours had their MagiÅ¿trates vnder them, in all their prouinces, and places of their dominions, from whome all their authoritie was, and who was at their beck and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement: So in the Popes Kingdome, the Pope who is the head, and the Senate of Cardinals whilk is next him in authoritie, hes their Å¿eate in Rome: and they according to

And I Å¿ay this great ciety of Rome, whilk is called heir myÅ¿ticall Babylon, is not deÅ¿criued heir, as Å¿he was the Å¿eate of the heathen Em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perors, when they raigned in her, as the Romane Kirk Å¿aies, but as Å¿he is, and hes bene the Å¿eate of the AntichriÅ¿t. For in the time of the Emperours, Å¿hee made not the Kings of the earth commit fornication with her: that is, Å¿hee did not pollute them with her idolatry and religion, as it is foretolde of this Rome: for Å¿he left euery kingdome free to vÅ¿e their owne Idolatrie and Å¿uperÅ¿tition: But Rome Å¿ince Å¿he began to be the throne and Å¿eate of the AntichriÅ¿t, the
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:20312:207"/> Popes of Rome hes propagated her idolatry and worÅ¿hip to all nations, and hes made all nations drunken with the wine of her fornication: and hes obtruded her religion to all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, againÅ¿t their wil, with fire and Å¿word. And from thence hes proceeded all the warres and blood-Å¿heds, in many na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Europe, becauÅ¿e they did goe out of her, and depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from her idolatry.</p>
                     <p>Further, all the partes of her deÅ¿cription heir, aggrees to Rome, hauing the Å¿hewe of ChriÅ¿tianity, and not as Å¿he was Ethnick vnder the Ethnick Emperors, as that purple and skarlet wherewith Å¿he was clade, that gilding with golde &amp; precious Å¿tones, and pearles: whilk the Arch-biÅ¿hop of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisbon, Albertus Magnus,</hi> and the gloÅ¿Å¿e interprets of the Å¿imu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of pietie and meekeneÅ¿Å¿e, and the Å¿pirituall graces of God: as faith, hope, charitie: all whilks (Å¿ay they) Å¿he Å¿hall in hypocriÅ¿ie pretend: but yet in truth haue nothing Å¿ik: but crueltie and vngodlineÅ¿Å¿e, the whilk can no wayes aggree with Rome, as Å¿he was in her GentiliÅ¿me: therefore of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿sity PapiÅ¿ticall Rome is heir deÅ¿criued, and not Ethnick Rome. Thirdly, that Rome is heir deÅ¿criued, whilk was vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden by the beaÅ¿t, vnto whome the ten Kings yeelded vp their power, to fight againÅ¿t the Lambe, as is manifeÅ¿t by the 12. and 13. verÅ¿es of that 17. chapter. But this beaÅ¿t is not the empire of Rome, but the AntichriÅ¿tian kingdome: for theÅ¿e ten Kings had not receaued their Kingdomes all that time that the Romane Emperours were Ethnick, and long after: Therefore Rome as it is the Å¿eate of the AntichriÅ¿t, &amp; not as it was the Å¿eate of the romane Empire, is heir deÅ¿cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. And the RhemiÅ¿ts Å¿ayes, that Å¿ome expones theÅ¿e ten Kings, of ten kingdomes,
<note place="margin">In their annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vpon this place.</note> into whilk the Romane empire Å¿hall be deuided, whilk Å¿hall all Å¿erue AntichriÅ¿t: therefore Rome as it is heir deÅ¿criued, muÅ¿t be the Å¿eate of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriÅ¿t.</p>
                     <p>LaÅ¿t of all, the <hi>Reuelation</hi> Å¿peakes heir of that Rome that Å¿halbe brunt with fire, &amp; be made deÅ¿olate by the ten king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, whilk God Å¿hould Å¿tirre vp to hate her; &amp; he Å¿peaks heir of that Rome whilk Å¿halbe caÅ¿ten in the middes of the
