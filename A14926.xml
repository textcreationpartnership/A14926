            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Remember that he cannot abyde the interceſſion of his owne Spirit in his owne.

                  <head>The principall points handled in this firſt part, are theſe</head>
                  <p n="1">1. THat the Kirk of Rome is not the Catholick Kirk, in no reſpect, as they vaunt of themſelues, but a particular Kirk: and that impure, rotten, dead, &amp; Antichriſtian.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the Kirk of Chriſt both may erre, and hes erred in al ages, before the law vnder the law, in the time of Chriſt, after his aſcenſion, in all ages, aſwell ſeverallie, as ioint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in councels both Prouinciall, and generall: and that the Kirk of Rome, and their heades the Popes of Rome, hes moſt foullie erred.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That the falſet of the Religion of the Kirk of Rome may be ſufficientlie made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by comparing the doctrine of the Kirk of Rome, with the doctrine of Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, ſet downe in the Scripture, ſuppoſe all the reſt of the circumſtances of changes and mutations, as the firſt perſon, time place and ſo forth be not diſtinctly ſet down in hiſtories.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The authour, time, place, and ſo forth of the reſte of the circumſtances of the change of the doctrine of the Kirk of Rome, is ſet downe diſtinctlie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> firſt, as the Scripture foretolde it, and alſo ſome of the auncients and hiſtoriographers, in ſome particular heades, hes noted out theſe circumſtances.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That our Religion was neither firſt invented by Martine Luther, nor yet firſt preached by him, but was inſt tuted by Chriſt in his Scripture, and was profeſſed by his Apoſtles, and the Primitiue Kirk, and the true Kirk of Chriſt in all ages. And that hee departed not from the true Kirk, but from the ſocietie of Babel, and the peſt of that Antichriſtian kingdome: &amp; that he had the Lord Ieſus, his Apoſtles, and all the primitiue Kirk, and all theſe that profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the true Religion, to be his predeceſſors.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Who ſhould be ſupreeme iudge in all controverſies of religion: to wit, the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus in his word, and not the Pope and his councell, as they ſay: and the true cauſe wherfore they decline the Lord, both to be Iudge in his word, &amp; witneſſe in his authentick ſcripture the Hebrew and Greeke fountaines, and will haue none to be iudges, but themſelues, their owne Popes, the fathers and forgers of their owne religion, becauſe they both knowe in their conſcience that the principall points of their doctrine is not written, or warranted in the Scriptures of God. And alſo ſome of themſelues through the forcible conviction of the trueth, hes bene compelled to grant, and to ſet it downe in write, that the principall pointes and foundaments of their Religion, hes not their authour, origen, nor beginning in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor cannot be warranted and defended by the ſame: and therefore they knowe aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redlie, that if the Popes be not admitted to be iudge in their owne cauſe, their Religion will be gone.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. That the whole certaintie of all their doctrine and religion, and of the doctrine of the Scriptures, by their owne confeſſion, depends vpon the teſtimonie of the preſent Kirk: that is, the preſent Popes, and his Cleargie: and that the certaintie both of our doctrine, that it is of God, and alſo of the diuinitie of the Scriptures, depends not vpon the teſtimonie of the Kirk of Rome, for that were a weake threed, nor of the teſtimonie of anie Kirk only or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipallie, but vpon other moſt infallible grounds.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Sundry points of doctrine controuerted amongſt vs, whilk were caſten in as examples by M. Gilbert, to proue that his religion was warranted in the Scripture, and ours not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by the ſame As 1. the abſolute neceſſitie of Baptiſme. 2. Freewill, and the poſſibilitie to keepe the commandements of God abſolutelie and perfitely. 3. Tranſubſtantiation. 4. The authority of Prieſts to forgiue ſinnes. 5. The Sacraments of extreame vnction, impoſition of hands, and of marriage. 6. That the band of marriage is d ſſoluble for the cauſe of adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. 7. Merites of workes. 8, Works of ſupererogation. 9 Chriſts locall deſcenſion to Hell. 10. Iuſtification by works. All whilks are moſt euidentlie convicted and confuted by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of the Scripture: and manie of them alſo by the teſtimonies of the auncient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and ſome of their owne teſtimonies of Popes, Cardinals, Doctors, and others.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. That Fathers cannot be iudges of the controuerſies of Religion, not yet the expoſition
<pb facs="tcp:20312:21"/> of the Scriptures ſhould be tried by them: but onlie the Scripture to be exponed by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: and their expoſitions in ſo far forth to be embraced, as they aggree with them. And that both becauſe they may erre, hes erred, and alſo their expoſitions diſſents one from another: and this is proued both by the teſtimonies of ſome of the Fathers and ſome of the moſte learned Papiſts</p>
                  <p n="10">10. That the Apocrypha is not Canonicall Scripture, whilk is alſo prooued by the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of ſome of their owne Popes, Cardinalles, and Doctors.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. That the defection foretolde in the Scripture in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ime of the Antichriſt, ſhould be a vniuerſall defection of all ſorts, except the elect.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. That the Kirk of Chriſt in the time of the Antichriſts defection and tyrannie, ſhoulde be redacted to a ſmall handfull, and ſhould be latent, &amp; lurke, for to eſcape his cruelty and tyrannie.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. That the ſpace of 1260. daies wherein the Antichriſt ſhould raigne, and the nomber of the true Witneſſes of God that ſhould preach the truth all that time, the ſpace of their prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, their cloathing, the place of the ignominious handling of their carcaſes, and their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving and aſcending vp to heauen, as they are ſet downe in the Reuelation, is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not literallie, as Maiſter Gilbert does, but figuratiuelie after the cuſtome of theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies in this Revelation.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. That the Popes are not the head of the Kirk, nor acknowledged by the Kirks in al ages to be the head thereof: but his Monarchie is condemned by Chriſt Ieſus, and his Apoſtles in his word, by the Fathers of the Primitiue Kirk, by fiue ſundry Prouinciall councels, and by nine generall Councels, and by fiue Vniuerſities, and by the Kirks of Grecia, Aſia, Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couia, Aethiopia, Boeme, Piemont, and all the reformed Kirks throughout Europe, ſo that if it were but put to an aſſiſe of theſe, his Monarchie would be condemned.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. That the Catholick Kirk is inviſible, and in what reſpects we affirme ſhe is inviſible, &amp; that the particular viſible Kirks heir, may be obſcured, rare, and brought to ſik a few hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that they are not openlie knowne and ſeene to all: but onlie ſome of them amongeſt themſelues, and ſome of them to their perſecuters, as it was foretolde in the Scriptures of God in the time of the Antichriſt, and as it hes bene accompliſhed in the time of Popery.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. That our Religion was preached and profeſſed in all ages, by Chriſt, his Apoſtles, the primitiue Kirk, the auncient Fathers, and by ſundrie in the middes of Poperie, who were condemned and perſecuted, and put to death manie of them, for ſpeaking againſt their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and that manie hundreth yeares before Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>Now I reaſon thus.

Secund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, the Catholicke Kirk comprehendes them that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt: But the Kirk of Rome comprehendes not them, for there was a Kirk, or euer there was a Kirk at Rome, and the Romane Kirk comprehends nane but them that acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges the Pope to bee the head of the Kirk. But thoſe that were before Chriſt neuer did that: Therefore the Romane Kirk is not the Catholicke Kirk. Thirdlie, the Catholicke Kirk is inviſible: for at the leaſt, neither are they that ar glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, neither are they that are to bee borne, viſible. But ye wil not haue the Romane Kirk, but alwayes viſible, therefore the Romane Kirk is not the Catholicke Kirk. Fourthlie, if the Romane Kirk be the Catholicke Kirk, then either it ſhall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the Pope is the heade of the Catholicke Kirk, or elſe that the Romane Kirk wants a viſible heade. Chooſe you whether of theſe ye will, for the ane ye muſt, if ye will haue the Romane Kirk to be the Catholicke Kirk. But to ſay that the Pope is the head of the Catholicke Kirk, I trowe ye dare not be ſo blaſphemous: for the gloryfied Saints, &amp; <hi>Peter</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe are of the Catholicke Kirk, or elſe (as I ſaid before) Pope <hi>Pius</hi> and the fathers of <hi>Trent</hi> erres. And ſo then if ye will make him heade of the Catholicke Kirk, ye muſte make him heade
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:20312:23"/> of the gloryfied Saints and of <hi>Peter</hi> alſo. So then chooſe you whether will ye leaue the ſtyle of Catholicke, whilk ye claime as proper to your Kirk, or will ye haue the Pope the heade of the triumphant Kirk in heauen: or laſt of all, will yee haue your Romane Kirk to want a viſible heade: ane of theſe ye muſt chooſe. So to ende this poynte, this ſtyle of Catholicke it is like the numbering of the people by <hi>Dauid:</hi> for as it brought him in a wonderfull ſtraite,
<note place="margin">2. Sam. 14.</note> when he ſawe it behoued him to chooſe, either ſeauen yeares famine, or foure moneths flying before his enemies, or three daies peſtile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. So this title of yours if you will bide by it, brings you in a wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derful ſtrait: for yee haue not the choiſe of ane of three euils, but theſe three things muſt ye either chooſe, or elſe let this ſtyle of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke goe; ane of you fighting againſt ane vther, the Kirk inviſible, and the Pope not to bee the heade of the Kirk. Of the whilk, the leaſt of theſe is more able to overthrow your Kingdome, then they all were able to haue ouerthrowne the Kingdome of Dauid, for they are the maine pillers of your Kingdome, your vnitie, your viſibilitie, your Popes ſuprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, all whilk you muſt either loſe, or elſe let your ſtyle of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke goe from your Kirk. But howe will ye wreſtle your ſelfe out of this? For if ye will beleeue the fathers of <hi>Trent,</hi> and Pope <hi>Pius,</hi> in defyning the Catholick Kirk, ye cannot eſchew thir inconveniences. And if you wil not beleeue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they ſpake trulie in that poynte, ye muſt accuſe them of error. And ſo the Kirk hes erred, the Pope hes erred, and your ſelfe hes erred that ſaid your Kirk hes the trueth in all thinges.

Next I ſay, ſuppoſe when ye are brought to this ſtrait, ye muſte ſay ſo: yet for al this, not onlie call ye your Kirk Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke, becauſe of the ſoundnes of doctrine whilk yee ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſhe profeſſes, but

Therefore ye call it the onlie true Kirk, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Catholicke Kirk: for out of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Kirk there is Saluation, but out of the Catholicke Kirk there is no ſaluation. Thirdlie I ſaye, as the epiſtles of <hi>Peter, Iohn, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> are intituled <hi>Catholick,</hi> not becauſe of the ſoundneſſe of their doctrine, whilk is common to the epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles of <hi>Paul</hi> alſo, and al the reſt of the Scripture, whilk in that reſpect may alſo be called Catholicke, but becauſe they are written generallie to all: So the Kirk is called Catholick pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, not becauſe of the ſoundnes of doctrine, for that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all the particular Kirks, that hes the puritie of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but becauſe it comprehends all the particular Kirks and all the elect. And alſo to put a difference betweene the Kirk of the Iewes, whilk did comprehend but ane certaine peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, &amp; the Chriſtian Kirk ſince the comming of Chriſt, whilk is not bound to any certaine place or nation, or people, but indifferently receaues al, both Iew and gentile that beleeues. &amp; therfore is it called Catholick: &amp; therfore in our beleef we ſay not, I beleeue the Catholick doctrine, but the Catholick Kirk. So by this ſhe is properlie diſtinguiſhed from particular kirks, as the Mother from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> daughters, &amp; the hail body from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> particular members.

And thirdly, ye deceaue the ſoules of the ſimple thereby, by making them beleeue there is not ane vther Kirk but yours.

But if ye meane of the viſible Kirk, that it ſhall neuer faile, &amp;c. that is, it ſhall neuer faile in doctrine, nor be interrupted in the ſame, not onelie in matters neidfull to ſaluation, but in all truth, as ye affirme of your Kirk, and as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſayes, as hath bene ſaide before, If ye go this farre, as ye doe indeede, and as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> does, and your ſelf muſt doe, if ye be a right defender of your Catholicke faith heere, or elſe there is no grounde whereupon ye can builde the puritie and trueth of your Kirk and religion. Then I ſay, that your ground is als falſe and erroneous, as the ſtuffe that yee builde vppon it, for both they haue failed, and hes beene interrupted, as ſhalbee prooued afterwarde. And marke this, Chriſtian reader, as the Philiſtims Kirk wherein they praiſed their God,
<note place="margin">Iudg. 16</note> &amp; moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Samſon the Lords ſeruand, had two cheef pillers wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the haill houſe leaned and was borne vp, ſo hes the Kirk of Rome two cheefe pillers, whereon the haill wecht of their Kirk &amp; religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hings: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one whereof is this, that the Kirk can not erre: the other that the Pope is the head of the kirk. Take
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:20312:27"/> theſe two from them, their houſe muſt fall, and their religion can ſtand no longer. For when they are brought to this ſtrait that they ſee they cannot defend their religion, neither by the teſtimonies of the Scripture, nor yet by the examples of the Kirk of God, when ſhe was in her greater puritie and ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, they are compelled to lay this as a grounde to holde all their errors on, that the Kirk of Chriſt cannot erre: So take this ground from them, their Kirk and religion cannot ſtand.</p>
                     <p>Now, as to the teſtimonies whilk ye quote out of the olde Teſtament, and out of the firſt of Luke, verſ. 33. in the new te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, they onelie prooue that the Kirk and kingdome of Chriſt ſhall indure for euermore, and that his couenant made with her, is euerlaſting. The whilk cannot exeeme the milita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Kirk from erring in points of doctrine, for both the chaffe &amp; euil ſeed in the Kirk, that is, theſe that are called, but not cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, may erre, and that to death and damnation, and yet his Kirk and kingdome, and his couenaunt, remaineth ſure, ſtable, and inviolate: for the Lord onelie offers his couenant vnto them, and they through incredulitie reiect it, and ſo he is not bund to ſanctifie or ſaue them, meikle-leſſe to keip them from error. And as for theſe who are called &amp; cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, all theſe promiſes are made and performed in euerie one of them, and the couenaunt of God is ſo ſure in euerie one of them, that our Sauiour ſayes, <hi>None of them can periſh.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ioh, 10.28</note> And yet for all this, euerie one of them may erre in doctrine, ſuppoſe not to death and damnation, whilk ye will not deny. And gif ye would, infinite examples not onlie of the Saints of God, of the laickes (as ye call them) but alſo of the Prieſts, Prophets, Apoſtles; yea, and of Popes alſo, and of your owne Doctours and Biſhops, as a cloude of witneſſes, would ſtand vp and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowe the ſame in your face. Nowe I gather, ſeeing that the militant Kirk heir on earth hath but two ſorts of perſons in her, theſe that are called and choſen, and theſe that are onelie called but not choſen, &amp; both may erre in points of doctrine, the one finallie to death and damnation: the other may erre, ſuppoſe not finally to death and damnation, &amp; yet the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt of God remaine ſure, euerlaſting, and inuiolate with
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:20312:28"/> his Kirk. Therefore, I ſay, the promiſes of the ſtabilitie of Chriſts kingdome, and the perpetuitie of his couenant made with her, cannot exeeme the militant Kirk from erring in points of doctrine: ſa ye haue loſt your vantguarde. Let vs cum to the reſt, and ſee if they will fauour your cauſe any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter nor the former hes done.</p>
                     <p>The next place ye quote is the 16. of Matthew, ver. 18. <hi>Thou art Peter, and vpon this rocke I will builde my Kirk, and the yets of hell ſhall not preuaile againſt it.</hi> And becauſe ye truſt that there is not a teſtimonie of ſcripture whilk ſhall feight mair for you nor this: let vs therefore try it to the vttermoſte, and ſee how far it can be ſtreatched out. What argument will ye frame out of this place? for, if you gather no more but this, Chriſt hath promiſed that the gates of hell ſhall neuer preuaile againſt the Kirk that is builded on the rocke, that is, on Chriſt: Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Kirk that is builded on him, ſhall neuer be alluterlie exſtinguiſhed and aboliſhed by Satan. Then <hi>Bellarmine</hi> telles you that ye ſpend but time in proouing of this, for we graunt it, That the Kirk of the choſen ſhall neuer periſhe. But if you go farther, and ſay: That the Kirk of Chriſt ſhall neuer erre, becauſe Chriſt hath promiſed that the yettes of hell ſhall not preuaile againſt it: then, I ſay, either that expoſition is falſe, or els y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gates of hel ſhuld haue preuailed long ſince againſt your kirk: for whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it preuailed againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rock wheron the kirk was builded, it preuailed againſt the Kirk. For, raze &amp; ouerturne the foundation of a houſe, the houſe cannot ſtand, ſeeing the ſtanding of the houſe conſiſts on the firmneſſe and ſureneſſe of the foundation thereof. Nowe the rocke whereon ye ſay the Kirk is builded vnto whome this promiſe is made, is <hi>Peter and his ſucceſſors the Popes of Rome,</hi> for ſo ye all with one conſent expones the ſame.

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:20312:28"/> the kingdome of Chriſt not to be heauenlie but earthlie,
<note place="margin">Act. 1.6.</note> not ſpirituall, but like the kingdomes of this world, proper to Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, not common to all by vertue of the promiſe: and alſo he is commanded to preach the Goſpell to the Gentiles,

                        <hi>doubting nothing.</hi> Whilk teſtifies, that he doubted before whether the Goſpell ſhuld be preached to them or not, &amp; therefore erred in a matter of faith, &amp; that after he had receaued y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> promiſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> haly Gaiſt.
<note place="margin">Ac. 10.14</note> And alſo he erred in the abrogation of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall Lawe: for he beleeued that ſome meates were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane after the death and reſurrection of Chriſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he refuſed to eate thereof. And this was a matter of faith alſo. And laſt of all, the halie Ghaiſt teſtifies,
<note place="margin">Galat. 2.11</note> that <hi>he went not a right foote to the truth of the Goſpell,</hi> and therefore was rebuked by the Apoſtle Paule to his face.

                     <p>The next place whilk ye quote,
<note place="margin">Matth. 26.</note> is that prayer of Chriſt for <hi>Peter,</hi> Luc. 22.32. <hi>But I haue prayed for thee that thy ſaith ſaile not.</hi> It is true he prayed: It is true alſo that <hi>Peter</hi> faith fayled not: but yet it ſwouned, as it were, when he denyed his Lord and that by mainſwering and curſing of himſelf: and yet he erred, both in the qualitie of Chriſts kingdome,
<note place="margin">Act. 1. &amp; 10 Gal. 2</note> in the calling of the Gentiles, and in the abrogation of the Ceremonial law: as alſo, he went not rightlie to the truth of the Goſpell, as hes bene proued. So this prayer was not that he ſhould be kept abſolutelie from all erring, for then it ſhall follow, that Chriſt obteined not that whilk he prayed for: ſeing he erred (whilk is impious to think) but that his faith ſhould not decay final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and totallie. Secondlie, the Lord Ieſus prayed alſo for all the beleeuers, Ioh. 17.18.19.20. whilk place ye alſo quote, and yet there is not one of the beleeuers but they may erre, as your ſelues cannot deny, &amp; we haue proued by examples of your owne Popes: for if any were exeemed from erring, in your iudgement it ſhould be theſe that are the foundation of your kirk, whilk ye call your Popes, but they may erre, and haue erred, as hes bene proued.

                     <p>As to that place whilk ye quote in the 14. of Iohn, ver. 16. and 17.

Therefore this promiſe will not reach ſo farre as to keip the kirk from impoſsibilitie of erring.</p>
                     <p>As to that place in the 17. of Iohn, I anſwered to it before.</p>
                     <p>As to the 28. of Matthew, <hi>I will bee with you to the ende of the worlde,</hi> I anſwere the ſame thing to it, whilk I anſwered to the former: that this promiſe is made, not to any viſible and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nar ſucceſsion, (for that is to tye the promiſes of God to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons &amp; places) but to the Paſtors of the kirk whome he ſends forth, and to all the faithfull: and is performed in them in ſo farre forth as may ſaue them, and inable them for his worke. But yet this will not exeeme them from all poſsibilitie of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</p>
                     <p>As to that in the 1. Tim. 3. ver. 15. the kirk is called the <hi>pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler and ground of truth,</hi> therefore ye gather, It cannot erre.

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:20312:32"/> kirk was the kirk of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> then the <hi>kirk of Epheſus</hi> is called the <hi>ground and piller of truth.</hi> But firſt, the kirk of <hi>Epheſus fell from her firſt loue, and the Candle-ſticke is threatned to be remoued from her,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Reuel. 2.5</note> 
                        <hi>vnleſſe ſhe repent:</hi> She did not repent, but in time became worſe and worſe, and ſo heaped fault vpon fault, till Chriſt hath now remooued his candle-ſticke from her, and delyuered her o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to darknes and death, by taking his owne elect to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and giuing ouer the reprobate that hated the truth to the blindneſſe of their owne minde: ſo that cietie is left deſolace to the impietie of Mahomete, and ſhe that was once called by Gods Spirit the piller and ground of truth, hath now loſt the truth. Now, I ſay, that whilk may befall one kirk, may befall anie other kirk. Then that whilk is befallen to the kirk of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus,</hi> may befall any other: But the kirk of Epheſus was firſt craiſed, and then by little and little quyte ouerthrowne: and beeing bereft of the light of Chriſt, is nowe a kirk no longer. Therefore, I ſay, that there is no kirk on the face of the earth, howſoeuer they flatter themſelues with glorious ſtyles of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick, pillers and ground of the truth: whoſe bodie, that is, the elect and choſen in it, may not bee ouerſhadowed with darkneſſe, and ouertaken with faintneſſe: whoſe chaffe, that is, the hypocrites in it, may not bee haillilie conſumed with rottenneſſe and deſtruction, and whoſe whole frame and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward gouernment, may not looſe both their ſtrength &amp; bew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Thirdlie, I ſay, If the kirk cannot erre, as ye ſay, becauſe it is the ground and piller of truth: and if the kirk of <hi>Epheſus</hi> be called the piller &amp; ground of truth, as the ſcripture ſayes; and ſeeing the kirk of <hi>Epheſus</hi> with all the kirkes of the Eaſt, (as ye cannot deny) hath condempned the Popes ſupremacy as hereſie: Therefore one of theſe two muſt follow, either that the kirk, that is, the piller and ground of the truth, not onely may erre but hes erred, or els it is an hereſie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dempned ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred years agoe, that the Pope is the head of the kirk, &amp; ſo Papiſtrie is hereſie.

<note place="margin">Philip. 2.16</note> the kirk is called the piller and ground of trueth, becauſe it is her office and dutie <hi>to holde out the worde of trueth, as lanternes and lights,</hi> by preaching it and practiſing it; as

                     <p>Nowe I come to your laſt teſtimonie of Scripture, Act. 5.39. In that counſell of <hi>Gamaliel</hi> to the councill of the Scribes and Phariſies, that <hi>if the doctrine of the Apoſtles be of God, that it cannot be deſtroyed.</hi> What do ye gather heere? That the truth doth remaine for euer? <hi>Bellarmine</hi> telleth you, that ye ſpend but time in prouing that, for we graunt it vnto you. It cannot (I graunt) be deſtroied, but yet it can be perſecuted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued out of places where it was before, and obſcured and corrupted by mens gloſſes and traditions, as it hath bene this thouſand and fiue hundreth yeares by the Iewes, to whome this was ſpoken. That if the doctrine of the Apoſtles was of God, they could not deſtroy it: and yet (as was ſaide) they baniſhed it, and made the Lord to depriue them thereof, and to giue them ouer to the blindneſſe and hardneſſe of their hearts, becauſe they would not embrace the trueth when it was offered.</p>
                     <p>Seeing then there is not a ſillab in Gods word, that wil vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde this maine foundation of your kirk, (that <hi>the Kirk can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not erre</hi>) take heede to your ſelf, <hi>(M.

I might end heere, but becauſe this point, (as I ſaid before) is the main piller that vpholdes the whole weight of their kirk and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: therefore I will vtterlie ouerthrowe the ſame, and I will proue out of the worde of God that the kirk in all ages, both may erre,
<note place="margin">Marc. 10.18. Rom 3.4.9 10.11 12. &amp; 19. ver.</note> &amp; hes erred. And firſt the Scripture teſtifies, that it is onlie proper to God alone by nature to be perfitelie holy, and true and free from all errors. And contrariwiſe man by nature is vnholie, a lyar, prone to deceaue, and to be decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued:
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:20312:33"/> ſo that by nature he is nothing elſe but a maſſe of blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and corruption: ſo that the light he hath, he hath it by free grace, by Gods Spirit, to make him ſee ſo meikle of his light in the face of Chriſt, as may ſaue him. But yet ſo long as they are in this houſe of clay, they ſee but in part:
<note place="margin">1. Cor. 13.12.</note> and that part whilk they ſee, is <hi>but obſcurelie and dimlie,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeakes. So that as long as they are in this worlde, they are ſubiect to ſinne, ignorance, and errors. But as there are two ſorts of men in the viſible Kirk: ſome called and choſen, ſome called, and not choſen: and as in the diſeaſes of the body ſome are curable, whereof men recouers, ſome are deadlie whereof men dyes: So is it in the errors of the militant Kirk, ſome are deadlie, &amp; ſome are curable.

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:20312:36"/> your Pope to be the head of the Kirk. For firſt yours is but in Europe, except ye will claime to the newe found land, &amp; not all Europe, for all the Kirks in Greece, whilk is a great part of Europe, acknowledges not your ſupremacie. Nowe take the Greeke Kirks from you, next the reformed Kirks in Scotland England, Germanie, Denmarke, France, Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Holland, and other places, whilk hes gone out of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, whilks are all in Europe, your nomber will not be many that acknowledges your ſupremacie.

Great ſurelie muſt be that priuiledge giuen vnto the Kirk of Rome that hes exeemed
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:20312:37"/> her from errour, all by hauing erred. What is then your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue aboue all other Kirks. I knowe that ye will ſay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of <hi>Peters</hi> chaire that was there wherein the Popes ſits after him. Firſt, then if <hi>Peters</hi> chaire hes ſuch an prerogatiue that the Paſtors who ſits in it and the Kirk that cleaues to it. can not erre. I think ſurely the Lords chaire whilk was at Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, whilk was called the Temple and ſeat of God, and <hi>Moſes</hi> chair wherein the Scribes and Phariſes ſate ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue that prerogatiue to freeth the Kirkes and Paſtors ſitting in theſe chaires from erring, yea the kirk whilk the trueth it ſelfe Ieſus Chriſt founded whom he taught with his owne mouth, and among whom he was crucified ſhuld with far greater right clame to that prerogatiue. But ſince al their ſeats hes erred, for the <hi>Temple became a den of theeues:</hi> The Scribes and Phariſes that ſate in <hi>Moſes</hi> chaire condemned the Lord of glorie: and Ieruſalem it ſelfe cried out <hi>Crucifie crucifie him.</hi> And the chriſtian Kirk gathered there are long ſince far from the way of ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. So that if neither the chair of God, nor <hi>Moſes</hi> freed the Kirk of the Iewes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> erring, nor the chaire of Chriſt freed the chriſtian Kirk there gathered from erring. How then can <hi>Peters</hi> chaire haue this preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue aboue them al as to exeeme that Kirk and Paſtors that ſits therein from poſſibilitie of erring? What is this but to prefer him before them all, whoſe ſeat hes a priuiledge that neither God nor his ſonnes, nor <hi>Moſes</hi> ſeat had? O high blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie to be deteſted and abhorred of all chriſtian hartes. But let vs ſee if it hes this prerogatiue whilk they aſcriue vnto it, or not. And firſt if it could haue exemid any from er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, ſhould it not haue exemed himſelf eſpecially from er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring? But as it hes bene ſhowen he erred. Therfore it can not exeeme neither his ſucceſſors,
<note place="margin">Act. 1.6. Gal. 2</note> nor yet the Kirk that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges them, from erring. Secondly if it had exeemed any Kirk from erring, ſhould it not haue exeemed the Kirk of <hi>Antiochia</hi> eſpecially, for ſurely <hi>Antiochia</hi> hes better right to clame to this prerogatiue,
<note place="margin">Galat. 2 11.</note> nor your Kirk hes. For firſt it was <hi>Peters</hi> firſt ſeat. Next the Scripture bears witnes to it, that he was there. But neither was Rome Peters firſt ſeate, nor is
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:20312:37"/> there ſo much as a ſillabe in al the ſcriptures, to proue that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <hi>Peter</hi> was in Rome.

Here we might ſtay now and goe no further: for this ſufficiently ouerthrowes this poynt of your doctrine, that the Kirk cannot erre, &amp; that be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the learnedſt of your ſide. But yet I will perſew the reſt. If you ſay it is granted to the body, then it is either gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the people or to the Clergie. To the people, I trowe ye will not; for if your Popes may erre, much more may your people erre: And if he Apoſtles &amp; other famous Kirks may erre, much more may your people erre: yea, if not, it ſhould followe that your people were aboue their head the Pope, whilk I trowe ye will not ſay. If yee ſay the Clergie, then ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it muſt be your Doctors ſeuerally by themſelues, or as they are gathered together in a councell. But as they are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall ye will not ſay. For your <hi>Bellarmines</hi> controuerſies would conuince you to the face: for almoſt there are few controuerſies whilk he handles (and he handles more nor 300) but hee brings in ſome of your owne writers diſſenting from him, and whome in many places he confutes. And I think if Popes hes not this priuiledge, ſurely the Doctors of your Kirk ſeuerally hes not this priuiledge. But becauſe (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confeſſeth <hi>if a generall councell erre, then the whole Kirk maye erre,</hi>

                     <p>As to your collection, the forme of it muſt be this. That Kirk onlie muſt be the trew Kirk that hes neuer bene inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, nor failed in any ſubſtantiall head of faith and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſince Chriſt and his Apoſtles. But ſay ye, yours is ſuch, and ours not: Therefore your Kirk is the true Kirk, and ours not. The propoſition I graunt. But all the controuerſie lies in the probation of your aſſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Yea, in ſtead of prouing ye ſay it is not poſsible to mee, nor to na Miniſter in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to aſsigne to you the circumſtances of all mutations &amp; changes in your religion, as the perſon, time, place, &amp;c. And then ye attempt to aſsigne al theſe circumſtances of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, vpon the whilk ye conclude the falſet of it. So we wil firſt ſee how ye proue your owne, and then ſee howe ye diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue ours. Indeed this argument of yours is of ſik accompt with you, that there are not manie of your writers, but they haue ſet it, as it were, in the vaunt-guarde of their hoſte, and amongſt the greateſt of their ſtrengthes and bulwarks, for to vp-holde their ruinous Babel. So <hi>Hammilton</hi> and <hi>Hay,</hi> in their demands to the Miniſters of Scotland, ſo <hi>Campion,</hi> ſo <hi>Duraus Scotus</hi> againſt <hi>Whitaker</hi> in his defence:
<note place="margin">Vpon the 28. of the Acts. and on 1. Ioh 1. Bellarm lib. 4 de Eccleſ cap 5</note> ſo your Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts: and ſo <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> Whereby it may be ſeene of what accompt this argument of yours is in the iudgement of your Kirk. But to anſwere to your argument: firſt, I ſay, If there be no mutations or changes in your Religion ſince Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles, then your religion and doctrine will be one with that quhilk is ſet downe in the Scripture of God. For you will not deny, I hope, but the Scripture doth ſufficiently teſtifie, what doctrine and religion was in Chriſts and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles dayes. And ſo let it once be put in the ballance of the Scripture, and tryed thereby, and then I hope it wil ſone be
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:20312:41"/> made manifeſt how far it is changed. So, and you dare, M. <hi>Gilbert</hi> let once your Religion be ſet vpon the Pannel, and let it once haue an aſſyſe of the Scripture, and then the plea will end, I hope. Next I ſay, it will not follow, We cannot aſsigne all the circumſtances of changes in your Religion: Therefore your Religion is vncorrupted. For it ſufficeth if we can proue the firſt onlie, that is, the matter or doctrine it ſelfe whilk is changed, and that by comparing it with the Scriptures of God, ſuppoſe we could not aſsigne all the reſt of the circumſtances of the mutation: as the time, place, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and ſo forth: for the changes of manie things are moſte notorious, and yet all the circumſtances of the change ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of not knowne. We ſay then it is not needfull to ſeeke the beginnings and circumſtances of the decayes and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in your Kirk, when the corruption and change it ſelfe is ſo manifeſt, by comparing your doctrine with the written worde of God, that it cannot be denied. For will you ſay, that he who is deadlie diſeaſed, is whole and ſound, becauſe I cannot tell you the firſt article of time, the place, and firſt occaſion of the diſeaſe? When it is manifeſt that a citty is full of miſorder and confuſion, wil ye ſay that ye wil not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it to be ſo, vnleſſe you knowe the firſt beginnings and progreſſe of theſe miſorders. If you ſawe a ruinous houſe, would ye ſay, Proue me and tell me all the circumſtances of the change of it, otherwiſe I will not beleeue it? Will ye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie that a ſhip could be drowned, vnleſſe it were tolde you all the circumſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of the change of the lecke where-throw it drowned. If any found a man faln in a pit, ſhall he not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that he is faln, whome neuertheleſſe he ſees to be ther, vnleſſe it were tolde him, when and by whome he was caſte into the ſame: Euen ſo, will ye not beleeue, or wil ye hinder al others to beleeue that your Kirk and Religion is ruinous, conſumed, rotten, dead, drowned, &amp; full of miſorder, hereſy, and confuſion, vnleſſe the firſt beginnings of theſe changes can be tolde you? We ſay therefore it is ſufficient to proue the ruine and conſumption of your Kirk and Religion, if by comparing your doctrine with the truth of God in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:20312:42"/> we make euident the direct oppoſition betwixt them, ſuppoſe wee coulde not aſsigne all the circumſtances of the change of it out of the hiſtories, leauing it free to Hiſtorio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers to write what they pleaſe, and omitte what they pleaſe. Thirdlie, it is manifeſt, that the Kirk of the Iewes in the time of Chriſt was changed both in doctrine &amp; manners from that eſtate that it was in the time of <hi>Aaron, Eleazar,</hi> and ſundrie others: and alſo the Kirks of <hi>Galatia</hi> and <hi>Corinthe</hi> that they were changed from the eſtate wherein they were. And yet I trow that neither ye, nor any Papiſt in the earth is able to aſsigne to me all the circumſtances of the mutations and changes in the ſame, as the firſt authours, time, place, &amp;c. &amp; yet there was a great change in Doctrine and Religion in al theſe Kirks, as hath bene proued before. And we read that our Sauiour and the Apoſtles, conuicted them of a change, and yet they deſigned not the firſt authours, time, and place and ſo forth. The like I ſay of the Kirk of <hi>Greece, Aſia</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frick,</hi> which in nomber exceedes yours. That there is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull change in their Kirk and Religion ye will not deny, or els your Religion is hereſie: for (as ſaid is) they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge not your Popes ſupremacie, Tranſubſtantiation, &amp;c. And yet I trowe ye, nor na Papiſt in the earth is able to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne al the circumſtances of changes in their Kirk, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which they haue preſentlie: yea, more vnable to doe this, nor we are able to doe the ſame in yours. I meane not the hereſies of <hi>Arrius, Samoſatenus, Neſtorius, Eutyches, Sergius,</hi> and the reſt, whilk long ago were damned by the Councels of the Greek Kirks. (For I trow ye ſhal not be able to proue that they now maintain theſe hereſies, whilk they condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and refuted long agoe.) But I meane of the preſent er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and corruptions in their worſhip and Religion, whilk now they maintaine and profeſſe. If then ye iudge the kirks of the eaſt heretical, becauſe they are not aggreable to your doctrine and Religion of Rome, and yet not be able to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne the circumſtances of the changes and mutations of the ſame? Will ye not grant the ſame libertie to vs to accompt and iudge your kirk and Religion failed, becauſe it is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:20312:42"/> to the doctrine of Ieſus Chriſt, ſet downe in the Scripture, ſuppoſe we could not aſsigne to you the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the changes of the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Fourthlie I ſay, if you haue read <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> there ye ſhall finde many hereſies, whilk I omit for ſhortneſſe, whilks he accompts hereſies, whoſe beginnings and authours are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne.</p>
                     <p>Fifthlie, there is ſik ane vniuerſall complaint of the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous abhominations and decaies in your Religion, diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, &amp; manners, &amp; that by your owne

Nowe, I aske that of you concerning theſe abuſes in diſcipline and manners, whilk ye aske of vs concerning your doctrine.

So it is proofe enough againſt
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:20312:43"/> your doctrine, that it is but tares, if the difference be made manifeſt betwene it and the Lordes trueth in the Scripture, ſuppoſe the circumſtances of the changes of it, can not be aſſigned.</p>
                     <p>Seuenthly, theirs is likened to <hi>leauen and a canker,</hi> whilk doth not all at once infect the whole maſſe, and feiſter the whole bodie; but peece and peece: ſo your corruption came not in all at once, but peece and peece infected your Kirk &amp; feiſtered your religion. And therefore it is no wonder ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the beginnings of infection and circumſtances of it, hes not bene marked: for if they had broken in all at once, and in a ſuddentie ouerthrowne the whole Kirk, it had bene no difficultie to haue aſſigned the circumſtances of the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of it. For if any hauing a whole conſtitution with an ſtroke were ſlaine, if an ſhip with an waue were drowned: it were no difficultie to aſſigne the circumſtances of the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den changes. But in a conſumption, and in a leck that hes come in peece and peece in the body &amp; in the ſhip, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings thereof cannot be ſo eaſily perceiued: for a little leck in proces of time will ſink a great ſhip. And if it be ſo hard to diſcerne the beginnings of theſe things whilk our ſenſes may grope, how much more hard is it to perceiue the beginnings of theſe ſpirituall corruptions whilk cannot bee perceiued by the natural man, but only by the light of Gods ſpirit by the ſpirituall man.</p>
                     <p>Eightly, if now it be ſo in other hereſies as the Scripture teſtifies of them that their begining are oft-times vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne, euen vnto the moſte diligent labourers of the Lordes huſbandrie and that they come in by little and little and doth not infect all at once, how much more is this true in your Antichriſtian religion, whilk (as it was fore-tolde) ſhould deceiue all nations and make them <hi>drunken with the wine of her fornication.</hi>

                     <p>Ninthly, it is likely ynough that the great credite where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the firſt Biſhopes of Rome was for their pietie and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and the loftie eſtate of their ſucceſſors after them, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their crueltie &amp; tyrannie did ſo dazell on the one ſide the eyes of the godly, that they were not inquiſitiue in marking the changes and beginnings of their corruptions, and ſo brideled the mouthes of other ſome that they durſt not write the thing they ſaw, and if they write any thing, they write it but barely &amp; corruptly, for the tyranny of your kirk was ſuch, that none durſt mutter againſt your Kirk and religion, but he was taken without further as an hereticke and condemned and executed where euer your tyrannie reached.</p>

The queſtion nowe comes in of the truth of our Kirk and Religion, whether it be from Ieſus Chriſt, or not. You ſay, it is not from him, but
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:20312:47"/> from others ſince his time. If ye had gone the ſtraight way to haue proued this and to haue ſatisfied the conſciences of men, you would at the neareſt haue runne to the Scripture, and by the ſame haue diſproued it. But you inſteede of this goe a farre by-way, and would father our religion on fleſhe and bloode, duſt and aſhes: in poynting vs out <hi>Martine Luther</hi> to be the father and author of the ſame, as though it had not an ancienter pedegre to reckon vnto, nor had not the begin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning &amp; foundation of it, from the roote of <hi>Ieſſe,</hi> the bud of the Lord from whome it hes ſprung. And for to get your ſelf the better credite you buſie your ſelf in marking the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of his preaching, as time, place, matter, oppoſition, &amp;c. Now that ye are ſo skilled and acquainted with that hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of <hi>Martine Luther,</hi> that you can aſſigne al theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, it is no wonder, for that was the moſt notable and markable period of the decaying of your Babell, and of the erecting vp againe of the kingdome of Ieſus Chriſt, whilk your head &amp; clergie had ſtampt it vnder foote for ſo many yeares, whilk ſuppoſe the beginning of it was but like <hi>a little leauen, and as a graine of muſtard-ſeed whilk of all ſeedes is the leaſt.</hi> Yet now ſince it hes ſo ſowred almoſt the whole maſſe, euen the moſt part of the kingdomes of Europe, whilk once was vnder your ſpirituall bondage, and hes growen vp into ſik a high tree hauing faire and great branches, vnder the whilk the Lords ſheepe may get reſte and warmneſſe, and in the whilk his ſoules that mounts vp-wardes to that kingdome, doth builde their neſts, ſo that neither can all your purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nor yet all your axes of fire and ſworde, of buls and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons of preachings and writtings, ſtay the ſpreading of the one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor cut downe the branches &amp; roote of the other. That <hi>M. Luther</hi> began at that time, and in that place, and preached againſt theſe doctrines, we do not deny, and that is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerted: But heere lyes al the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whether if that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that he preached againſt, was antichriſtian or not, &amp; whether that religion whilk hee neither invented, nor yet firſt preached (for ſundrie before him did preach that ſame doctrine, whoſe names I ſet downe in my anſwere to your
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:20312:47"/> obiection) but only raiſed it out of the graue of darknes wherein ye had buried the trueth of God. Heere then (I ſay) is the queſtion whether that religion whilk he preached hes the warrant from Ieſus Chriſt in his Teſtament or not? the whilk if ye euer diſproue by the written word of God, then ſhall we grant you all that ye ſay, the whilk is as impoſſible to you to doe, no not ſuppoſe your King would call all your wiſemen &amp; cleargie together,
<note place="margin">Daniel 2</note> as it was to all the wiſemen of <hi>Babell</hi> to tell and interprete <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> his dreame: yea, ſuppoſe your King would reward yow gloriouſly with honor and riches yf ye could do it, yet are ye not able to win your wages.

This is therefore the poynt whilk lies in queſtion betwixt vs, whilk ye ſhuld haue proued if ye could.

Your reaſon then is this. The true Kirk of Chriſt hes neuerfailed vniuerſally for the ſpace of one day, becauſe our Sauiour hes promiſed to be with it to the end of the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:20312:48"/> world. But our Kirk was neuer before <hi>Martine Luthers</hi> daies, therefore it is not the true Kirk of Chriſt. As to your propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, if ye sake failing for erring in matters of doctrine, then I denie your propoſition for I hope I haue proued ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently before that the Kirk both may erre and hes erred in all ages. But if you take failling to be vtterly aboliſhed and rooted out of the face of the earth, then I grant your propoſition, that God hes euer a Kirk, the Kirk of his elect, with whom he will be to the end of the world. And as to your aſſumption, that our Kirk was neuer before <hi>Martine Luthers</hi> dayes, I deny it. Let vs ſee howe ye proue it. There was none (ſay yee) before his daies neither viſible nor inuiſible that profeſſed his religion. But howe doe ye proue that, for that is ſtill denied to you? For if our religion hes the olde and new Teſtament to beare witnes to it, and Ieſus Chriſt to be the author of it in euerie poynt, as ſhall be made manifeſt by the grace of God, then I ſay whoſoeuer they were from the beginning of the world to this day viſible or inuiſible that profeſſed the true Ieſus, the true Sauiour, his true doctrine and Sacraments wherin religion ſtands, they are our prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, and are of our profeſſion and religion: ſo then ye ſhould firſt (if ye had gone ſquarely to work) haue diſproued the heads of our religion not to haue their warrand from the tables of Chriſts Teſtament, or ye had concluded that we had none of our profeſſion and Religion before <hi>Martine Luther.</hi> And this is the point you ſhould haue begun at, for it is not the Kirk that makes the religion, but the religion that makes the Kirk. Haue we a warrant out of the word of God for our religion, then are we the true Kirk, and the ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of all them who euer from the beginning of the vvorld hes profeſſed the ſame. Haue vve not this vvarrant then I graunt you vve haue no true Kirk. So there is the point of our controuerſie, vvhether our doctrine be from God, out of his vvord or not. But hovve proue ye that <hi>Martine Luther</hi> had none of his profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before him? Firſt you gathered vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the former things that all the true Kirks ſaide againſt him, and that he departed from them, vnto the vvhilk I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvvered
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:20312:49"/> before that theſe was not the trew Kirk, but only ſo many of euery natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who was deceiued by your doctrine, &amp; whereof the Lord did cure a great many by his miniſtry, &amp; by the miniſtrie of others whome the Lord did ſtirre vp ſince, ſo that neither did the trew Kirk who ſaw the trueth, ſpeak againſt nor yet did he depart from their ſocietie.

                     <p>Your next proofe is taken from an teſtimonie of one of our owne writers where ye alledge that it is written of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Luther</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> that they were the firſt that came to the knowledge of the Goſpell.

                     <p>In your anſwere to this ſection, firſt ye thinke it impoſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble becauſe of the forme of it. Next, ye ſay it is but an offer &amp; I proue nothing.

And firſt to the forme: ye thinke it impoſſible to proue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:20312:50"/> it is a negatiue propoſition. Is not this a negatiue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that the Popes of Rome are not the Antichriſt; you can not deny it. Againe, I ask is this ſentence to be found in the vvhole Scripture; I trovv ye vvil neuer be able to finde it. Then I ſay if it bee true that ye ſay,
<note place="margin">Bellarm lib. 3 de Rom. Pontif. Sanders 40 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations.</note> then ye your ſelfe in your booke and this your anſvver, and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Sande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> and all the reſt of you that takes in hand to proue the Pope not to be the Antichriſt, takes in hand in your iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment an impoſſibilitie (and ſo doe ye indeede, not becauſe it is a negatiue propoſition, but becauſe he is the Antichriſt in verie trueth.) What vvould the Pope your head thinke of you, if he heard you ſay ſo? Certainly I think he would not inroll your name among the defenders of his catholick faith vvhereof this is the foundation. Secondly, is there not many formall ſyllogiſmes that hes the propoſition or aſſumption negatiues, and wil you ſay they cannot be proued if the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be true, becauſe they are negatiues? What is this but to raiſe the foundation of Logick and Reaſon? Logick is not Rhethorick, &amp; Phyſick is not Logick: both theſe are nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue propoſitions, &amp; I trow neither of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are ſo found in the Scripture, and vvill you ſay that it is impoſſible to proue them, becauſe they are negatiues?

                        </gap> ſtriue about words, proue &amp; improue, forbidden by the Apoſtle. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ye except theſe negatiue propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, whilk are ſet downe in the word of God, whilk hes authoritie as ye ſay, I aſſume. But your religion in ſubſtance is condemned in the word of God: Therefore by your owne confeſſion it may be proued, ſuppoſe it be negatiue: For <hi>Nazianzene</hi> ſaies, <hi>that theſe ſentences that are collected out of the Scripture by a neceſſarie conſequence are of the ſame trueth and authoritie with theſe ſentences that are expreſly ſet downe in the Scripture.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Lib. 5. de Theolo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gia.</note> And wheras ye ſay Papiſtrie by me is not ſo olde as the Scripture, I grant that. What then? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not condemned in the Scripture; I deny that: for Antichriſt and his kingdome are not ſo olde as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and yet the Scripture condemned it. For not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns it preſent hereſies, but alſo the hereſies that was to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:20312:51"/> come. And ſeing Papiſtrie is that Antichriſtian religion, as ſhall be made manifeſt by Gods grace: therefore it hes the expreſſe condemnation of it in the word of God. The forme therefore of it, no wayes will make it impoſſible to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. As for the next thing, that I proue nothing, but offers verie faire. I anſwer it was not my purpoſe then, but I hope ye ſhall haue a proofe now of that whilk I offered then. As to the third then, that I can ſay nothing to your argument whilk ye would haue the reader to marke: vvhen I red this, I marked this, that ye would earneſtly haue the reader per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of the inuinciblenes of your argument and my ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie to anſwere. But what bring ye with you to perſwade him of the ſame? Your reaſon is, becauſe I haue not anſwered it. Will this follow, I haue not (ſuppoſe it were ſo as yee ſay) therefore I cannot? It will not follow (M. <hi>Gilbert</hi>) I haue not anſwered, I cannot anſwere to it. But as ye haue a new Theologie, ſo haue ye a newe Logick. But ſaid I nothing to your argument? What is not anſvvered ſufficiently in the ſame? Your argument vvas the antiquitie of your religion and continuance of it from Chriſt by a lineall ſucceſſion neuer interrupted, &amp;c. And the noueltie of ours. My anſwer vvas: yours vvas not inſtitute by Chriſt nor his Apoſtles in his Scripture as ours vvas, and yours vvas gaineſaide in the cheif poynts by the teſtimonies of the fathers the firſt 600. yeares, and the principall points of our religion confirmed by ſundrie of their teſtimonies. Thirdly yours vvas that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian apoſtacie that the Scripture fore-tolde ſhould come, and in the height of your tyrannie and Idolatrie vvas gainſayed by many before <hi>Martine Luther,</hi> and ours vvas profeſſed by ſundry before him vvhoſe names I ſet dovvne, all vvhilk I offered to proue, and novve ſhall doe by Gods grace. Novv you ſay this is no anſvvere. But is that no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvver that cuts the verie throte of your religion if it be vere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, &amp; hoghs your argument, that it doe neuer ſtand vp to vnder-propp your religion againe? For that religion vvhilk is not inſtituted by Chriſt in the Scripture, vvhoſe maine foundations is gainſaide by the teſtimonies of ſundrie of the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:20312:51"/> fathers of the firſt 600. yeare whilk is Antichriſtian, and whilk was gaineſaid by the Saints that they perſecuted and ſlew, hes not the continuance from Chriſt by a lineal ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion neuer interrupted nor ſpoken againſt by a true Kirk till <hi>Martine Luthers</hi> dayes. This I am ſure ye will not deny. But your religion is ſik as I offered then to proue, and now hes in ſome poynts, and ſhall in other ſome poynts by Gods grace. The whilk if it be verifyed, then I hope ye will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but that your religion hes neither antiquitie, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance nor ſucceſſion from Chriſt til <hi>Martine Luthers</hi> dayes. And that religion cannot be newly forged and inuented ſince <hi>Martine Luthers</hi> dayes, whilk hes the warrant and inſtitution of it in the Scripture &amp;c. This you cannot deny. But our religion is ſik, as then I offered to proue and now hes done in ſome poynts and ſhall doe in other ſome poynts by Gods grace. Therefore our religion cannot be newly forged and inuented &amp;c. but is the only true religion. So that this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere if it be proued, doth ſufficiently vindicat our religion fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> noueltie. Now if this be no anſwere to your argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I ſay no more, but ye will anſwer it the ſooner. And becauſe ye formed your owne argument your ſelfe in your anſwer to me, &amp; I haue anſwered to it els; therefore I wil now inſiſt no further vpon it. And as for your lineall ſucceſſion of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops it will come in queſtion afterward, therefore I omit it now.</p>

                     <p>You firſt here decline the Scripture as iudge, to decide all controuerſies in religion. And you are not the firſt that hes done this, but all your Romane clergie with you. And ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe there were not another thing to make the conſciences of men ſuſpect your religion that it is not found in the booke of God: yet this is a great preſumption that ye giue out of it your ſelues. For what may all men think of the ſame, but that if ye were perſwaded in your conſcience to iuſtify your religion to be from Ieſus Chriſt in his writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> word, ye would neuer decline the iudicatorie of it, and the declining of the ſame is an euident demonſtration that yee are priuie with your ſelues in your own conſciences that it is not from God in his writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> word.

So you not onelie put the Lord in his Scripture out of the benche, that he ſhould not iudge &amp; giue out the ſentence of doome againſt your doctrine, but by this exception alſo ye remoue him from the barre, that his teſtimonie in the Hebrewe and Greeke fountaines againſt you, ſhould haue no credite.

But you ſay, I haue no Scripture for mee, that the Scripture ought to be iudge. What will ye ſay then to Ieſus Chriſt in the 12 chap. 48. verſe of the Goſpell of Saint Iohn, ſpeaking to ſik as ye are, <hi>He that refuſeth me and receiueth not my words, hath one that iudgeth him, the word that I haue ſpoken it ſhall iudge him in the laſt day.</hi> Vnleſſe now ye be a man of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, ye muſt confeſſe that the word of Ieſus Chriſt, (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſo much is written as may make a man beleeue, and by beleeuing to get eternall life) is <hi>iudge and iudges preſentlie, and ſhall iudge alſo in the latter day.)</hi> Therefore the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>that God ſhall iudge the ſecrets of mens hearts by Ieſus Chriſt, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Goſpell.</hi> So the Goſpell ſhal be the rule of that great iudgement in that great day and ſo is it the rule of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip while we are in the way to that iudgement.

Your third reaſon is, the practiſe and cuſtome of the kirk in deciding the controuerſies of religion in councels: we grant that this is a verie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modious meane to ſearch &amp; find out the trueth by the Scripture: for firſt the more they are that ſeekes the trueth, it is the more eaſily found. Next the conſent of many in determining a trueth wil be of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter authority to repres heretickes nor if it were aggreed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on only by a few. But yet they ſhould determine nothing but that whilk is warranted by the Scripture, and their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations only in ſo far forth to be receiued as is aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the ſame.

Yea, is not this to prefer the voice and authoritie of your Popes and Cleargie to the voyce of God him ſelfe? For what is the teſtimony of your Kirk, but the teſtimony of men? And is not the ſcripture the teſtimony and voyce of God him ſelfe? Do ye not therefore lift vp the authoritie of your Kirk, that is, your Popes and Clergie aboue the authoritie of God in his word whilk as you ſay, that there is no other warrant of the Diuinitie of the ſcripture, but only the teſtimony of your Kirk? But God be thanked in Chriſt Ieſus who hes deliuered vs from this blindnes: for we haue other warrants (Maiſter <hi>Gilbert</hi>) whereupon the certaintie of our ſaluation and the Diuinitie of the ſcripture depends, nor by the teſtimony of the true Kirk much les the teſtimonye of your Kirk whilk is Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian, and giuen ouer of God to beleeue lies, and ſo worthie of no credite.

Next I ſay, your argumnt will not follow: there was no other Kirk im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before him &amp;c. Ergo, we haue no other warrant that the ſcripture is the written word of God.

For if you and your Romaine Kirk were ſo perſwaded, wherefore then ſhould ye haue declined to haue it tried by the ſame? and wherefore hes ſome of your owne chiefe pillers and defenders of your Romane religion who knowes the certaintie of the ſame, wherefore (I ſay) would they haue proclaimed it by write vnto the worlde, that the moſt part and the principall heads of their religion, are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written traditions, whilk hes neither their originall, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, nor authoritie in the Scripture, nor cannot be defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the ſame?

                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, ye begin at the neceſsitie of the Sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, whereof ye affirme that it is ſo neceſſarie, that infants cannot come to heauen without the ſame. As for Baptiſme we graunt that it is a moſt effectuall ſeale and pledge of our ingrafting in Chriſt Ieſus, and of the remiſsion of our ſinnes through his blood, &amp; regeneratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> through his Spirit, ſo that either the neglect or the contempt of it, (becauſe it is the ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>glect and contempt of the couenaunt it ſelfe, and of Chriſt Ieſus the foundation of the couenant) is damnable. But that it is ſo abſolutelie neceſſarie to infants, that without it they cannot come to heauen: to wit, theſe whome he hes prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, it being neither neglected nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temned, but death preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting the receiuing of it: that we allutterly deny as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, vngodlie, and cruell. For firſt I ſay there is none that is in the couenant of grace, &amp; who hes God to be their god, and are holy, that can periſh. This you cannot deny. But the children of the faithfull who are of his ſecret election are ſik before they be baptiſed. And this I proue. The Lord promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to <hi>Abraham I will be thy God and the God of thy ſeede.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen, 17, 17 Act, 2, 39. 2, Cor, 7, 14</note> And this Peter alſo teſtifies, <hi>The promiſe</hi> (ſaieth he) <hi>is made to you &amp; to your children.</hi> And the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>that the children of the faithfull are holie:</hi> Therefore the children of the faithfull who are of Gods ſecret election, ſuppoſe they die without Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, doth not periſhe. Secondlie, if Baptiſme were abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutelie neceſſarie to ſaluation, then the grace of God were bound to the Sacrament. This cannot be denied. But your Maiſter of ſentences ſayes, that the grace of God is not bound to the Sacraments, and it is impious ſo to thinke, that Gods free grace and ſaluation is bound to the inſtrument. Thirdlie, if Circumciſion was not abſolutely neceſſarie to ſal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uation in the old Teſtament, then Baptiſme is not abſolute neceſſarie now, becauſe Circumciſion was as ſtraitly enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to them, as Baptiſme is enioyned to vs, and Baptiſme is ſucceded in the roome of the ſame, but Circumciſion is not abſolute neceſſarie. For <hi>Lombardus</hi> is rebuked by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of <hi>Paris</hi> becauſe he ſo thought. And <hi>Dauid</hi> doubtes not
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:20312:59"/> to ſay of his childe who died the ſeuenth day, and ſo before he was circumciſed, <hi>I ſhall goe to him, &amp;c.</hi> and ſo he pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that he was ſaued: and al the time that they were in the wilderneſſe, almoſt 40. yeares, Circumciſion was neglected, whilk plainlie ſhowes, that it was not ſo abſolute neceſſarie, that ſaluation could not be obtained without it. Therefore Baptiſme is not ſo abſolute neceſſarie to ſaluation, as ye ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: for the grace of God is of no leſſe force in the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, nor it was in the olde. Fourtlie, we read of ſundry that receiued the holy Ghoſt before they were baptized, &amp; ſeing the holy Ghoſt where he is, regenerates to eternal life: Therefore life eternall is not bound abſolutelie to Baptiſme Fiftlie, what a croſſe and diſturbance is this, that your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine brings to the conſciences of all theſe parents, whoſe children hes bene preuented by death, before they could be offered to be baptized? if they beleeue your doctrine, how often will this come in their minde, that their children are damned. And ſeeing the infants themſelues are not in the cauſe that they are not baptized, but their death preuenting by Gods prouidence, or the Parents neglecting or contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſame, or perſecution, or one impediment or other hindering, wherefore are ye ſo cruell to iudge them to bee damned for that, whereof themſelues are cauſleſſe? And laſt of all, if ye be acquainted in the hiſtories of the Kirk of God in the firſt age, ye will finde many that delayed to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, vntill their latter age, whilk they would neuer haue done and they had thought it ſimpliciter neceſſarie to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as ye doe. And <hi>Ambroſius</hi> doubts not to ſay that <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinian wanted not the grace of Baptiſme, ſuppoſe he wanted Baptiſme it ſelf:</hi> the whilk he would neuer haue ſaide, if he had thoght it abſolutely neceſſarie to ſaluation. And <hi>Bernard</hi> ſayes, <hi>I can not altogether deſpaire of the ſaluation of them who wants Baptiſme not through contempt, but onlie through impoſſibilitie to get it.</hi> And in that ſame place hee ſayes. <hi>So alſo if our Sauiour Chriſt for this cauſe. When he had ſaide, hee that beleeueth and is Baptiſed ſhall bee ſaued: did of purpoſe in repeating the ſentence, omit to ſay: Hee that is not Baptiſed, but he that beleeueth not ſhall bee damned, for hee ſaw
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:20312:59" rendition="simple:additions"/> that faith only might ſuffice to ſaluation, and without faith nothing can ſuffice.</hi> Iuſtly then might your Popes ſentence and your own be ſaid to be cruell, in our confeſsion. But how proue ye this doctrine of yours to be Chriſts? Ye cite the three chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Iohn</hi> where our Sauiour ſaies, <hi>Except a man be borne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine &amp;c.</hi> vvhilk ſay ye is properly meaned of the ſacrament of baptiſme. Vpon the whilk ye infer the neceſſitie of the ſame. Whereunto I anſwere that interpretation of yours is falſe: for our Sauiour ſpeakes not here of the ſacrament of Baptiſme: and that for theſe reaſons: firſte, our Sauiour ſpeaks here generally of al men, and not of infants only, and therefore he ſayes, <hi>Except a man be borne &amp;c.</hi> ſpeaking to <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codemus</hi> who was a man and not an infant, ſo that if your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition were true all men that died without baptiſme and not infants only, are excluded from heauen. But that is falſe: for firſt the good theef was not baptiſed with water, and yet our Sauiour ſaide to him, <hi>this might thou ſhalt be with me in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe.</hi> And therefore our Sauiour ſpeakes not here of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of baptiſme: for he ſpeakes of that new birth by water and the ſpirit without the whilk none can be ſaued: but this theefe and others were ſaued without the baptiſme of water: therefore he ſpeakes not here of it. Next our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour in that place ſpeakes of that new birth by the ſpirit &amp; water whilk is ſo abſolutely neceſſarie to the ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of al men that it admits no exception. This cannot be denyed. But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> makes two exceptions againſt the abſolute neceſſitie of baptiſme: one of martyrdome, the other of true conuerſion and pennance,
<note place="margin">Lib, 1, de Baptiſ, cap. 6</note> whereof (ſayes he) either of them ſupplies the want of baptiſme. Therfore our Sauiour ſpeakes not here of the ſacrament of baptiſme. Thirdly if we will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue Chriſt Ieſus expounding him-ſelfe, and Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding Scripture, I ſay, by water is not alwaies meaned the ſacrament of baptiſme: but the purifying grace of Chriſt whilk is called the water of life, ſo our Sauiour ſpeakes in the 4. chapter of <hi>Iohn</hi> verſe 11. &amp; 7. chapter verſe 38, And in that ſame ſenſe water is here added to the ſpirit to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the more ſenſibly the efficacie of the ſpirit in waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:20312:60"/> and clenſing vs, as fire is added to the ſpirit in the 3. of <hi>Matthew.</hi> 11. verſ. He will baptize you with the ſpirit and with fire, whilk is not properly vnderſtoode of any naturall fire, but taken figuratiuely to expound more ſenſibly the force and eficacie of the ſpirit in burning vp our corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>Fourthlye, what an abſurd thing were this whilk ſhoulde follow if your expoſition were true, that for the want of the ſprinkling of a little water, the infants ſhould periſhe that are in the couenant, ſeing they were not the cauſe of the want of it. Further, I ſay, that ſuppoſe baptiſme were here meaned: yet there is no ſik neceſſitie as ye ſuppoſe, for if martyrdome and pennance may ſupply the want of this wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confeſſes) how much more may the holye Ghoſt ſupply the want of the ſame in infants: and if anye thing may ſupply the want of it, then it is not ſo abſolutely neceſſary that al theſe infants are damned that wants it.</p>

                     <p>It appeareth that Maiſter <hi>Gilbert</hi> is loath that the ſecrete of the doctrine of his Kirk ſhould be knowne to the people, becauſe he knowes in his heart they would abhor the ſame: their owne harts and conſciences witneſsing to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Therefore he hes hid vp the poiſon of it, and couered it as ſecretlie as he could. But that wherein you are darke, the reſt of your Romane cleargie are plaine. For firſt, whereas ye ſay, that a man by the grace of God, may keepe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
<note place="margin">Lib. 4. de Iuſtifie, ca. 10. Gratia Dei adiunante</note>

The reſt of your brethren are more plaine, in halfing it betwixt Free-will, and the grace of God helping Free-will, as though the ſtrenth of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture were the more principal cauſe, &amp; the grace of God but a helper to it.

                     <p>Now to anſwere you. Whereas ye ſay, that a man by grace may keep the commandements of God: if you meane that the onlie cauſe of the obedience of the children of God to his Law, is the renewing grace of God, and that this obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is ſincere and heartie, not to one, but to al the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements: not onelie outward, but inward: ſuppoſe not in that high meaſure of perfection that the Lawe of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyres: then, I ſay, you contradict the doctrine of your Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Kirk, and forſakes their error of Free-will concurring with grace, and of the perfection of man his obedience here to the Lawe, and ſo ſhakes hands with the trueth of God whilk we profeſſe in this point.

                        <hi>that the Law is impoſsible becauſe of the waik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the fleſhe.</hi> For the whilk cauſe the ſonne of God tooke on him our nature to fulfill this impoſsibilitie of the Lawe.

And beſide the plaine teſtimonies of the Scripture, euery mans owne dolefull experience telles them of their manifold and continuall ſinning.

                     <p>Now to the teſtimonies of Scripture whilk ye quote: and firſt, that in the 19. of <hi>Matthew, If you would enter into life, keepe the commandements:</hi> I anſwere: the ſame is to be ſaide to you, vvho ſeekes for life and righteouſneſſe by the vvorks of the Lawe, <hi>Keepe the Commands.</hi> But that are ye vnable to doe, or any man elſe, except the man the Lord Ieſus, (as hes beene proued:) and as vn-able as this young man was, to vvhome it vvas ſaide at the laſt, <hi>It is as impoſsible to him to go into heauen as to a Camell or Cable rope to goe through the eie of a needle.</hi> But ye
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:20312:63"/> vvill ſay, Wherefore then vvould our Sauiour Chriſt haue commanded him to keep the commandements, if he would haue life? I anſvvere: not becauſe he vvas able to doe it, but to bring him to a conſcience of the breach of it, <hi>for by the Lawe as the Apoſtle ſayes,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 7.7</note> 
                        <hi>comes the knowledge of ſinne.</hi> And to caſt dovvne that preſumption that he had of himſelf, that he had obſerued and keeped the Lawe, that in conſcience of ſinne, he might be brought to ſeeke for life eternal in Chriſt Ieſus onlie.</p>
                     <p>And leaſt Maiſter <hi>Gilbert,</hi> ye ſay that this is my expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: therfore heare what the Apoſt. ſaies. <hi>As many as are of the works of the law are vnder the curſe:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Galat 3.10.14</note> 
                        <hi>for it is written, Curſed is euerie man that continueth not in all thinges whilk are written in the booke of the law to doe them: and that no man is iuſtified by the law in the ſight of God it is euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</hi> Now this is ſpoken not only of the Iewes but of the Gentiles that beleeued in Chriſt Ieſus, and were vnder grace: vpon the whilk I reaſon thus. If as many as are of the workes of the law are vnder the curſe, and no man is iuſtified by the law in the ſight of God, then no man is able to get life eternall by keeping of the law, and ſo this young man to whome Chriſt gaue his anſwer, neither had kept nor could keepe the lawe: but the firſt is ſaide by the Apoſtle, therfore the ſecond is true. Next, the law requires a perfect obedience with <hi>all the hart, with all the vnderſtanding, &amp; thought, and ſtrength vnto all the commandements,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 22.37. Luc 10.17. Mar, 12.31 Deut. 27.16 Iac. 2.10</note>

Now who is he that is come out of the loynes of <hi>Adam</hi> (except only the Lorde Ieſus) who hes continued in the perfect obedience of all thinges without the breach of any in thought, word, or deede? Are you able (M. <hi>Gilbert</hi>) or hes euerie one of your Romane Kirks performed, or is able to performe this obedience that the law requires? Seing therfore y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> none is able, &amp; this young man neither had performed, nor yet was able to performe this perfect obedience to the lawe: therefore of neceſſitie it muſt follow that our Sauiour gaue him this command <hi>Keepe
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:20312:63"/> the commandements, &amp;c.</hi> not becauſe he was not able to keepe them, but to bring him by the lawe to a conſcience of the brek of them. As for the reſt of the Scriptures whilk ye bring in, they are eaſilie anſwered, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 14.15, 24. 1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 5.3. <hi>If yee loue mee keepe my commandements &amp;c. and he that loues me not keeps not my word &amp;c.</hi> I grant the Lord hes commanded obedience to his commandements. And I graunt they that loues him keepes them, and all the children of God loues him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnes alſo obedience to al his commandements. But yet as their loue is not in that perfection whilk the lawe requires, with all their hart, with all their vnderſtanding, and with all their ſtrength: ſo their obedience is not in that perfection. And neuer-theles the perfection of their obedience is forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, being couered with the perfect obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Ieſus Chriſt, and through him is acceptable in his preſence, and of him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſhall be crowned with a crowne of glorie, ſuppoſe freelie.

And laſt of al becauſe he by his ſpirit renewes the harts of his owne, and makes them able with ioy to begin that obedience: ſo that what they doe they doe it not vpon conſtraint, as being vnder the law: but willingly for the loue of Chriſt,

For haue you ſold your ſelfe ſo far to vn-trueth and lying, that for to bring the trueth of God whilk we profeſſe, in hatred: you will father on vs that doctrine whilk neuer ſo meikle as once entered into our thoughts, let be to teach it or write it. Did you think when ye write this, that the truth of it would neuer come to light? or thought you that ye regarded not to be controlled of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the laſt, ſo being that for a ſeaſon ye might make our Religion to be more abhorred through your calumnie? But froſt and falſet (as they ſay) will neuer haue a faire hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end. If you meane then by reſiſting the will of God, a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary diſobedience and repyning againſt the Spirite of God, and his reuealed will in his worde, as the teſtimonies whilk ye quote heere, imports: Then, I ſay, there was neuer man of our religion that profeſſed, taught, or write the contrary: &amp; ye will not finde a ſillable neither in the confeſſion of our faith confirmed by the act of Parliament, neither in our Pſalme booke to the contrary. For our doctrine is flat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to this: to wit, that man of his free-wil reſiſts that that is good, and chooſes the contrarie. So ye fight heir with your owne ſhadow.

                     </p>
                     <p>I come nowe to the fourth point of your doctrine, your Tranſubſtantiation and reall preſence. The firſt ye quote, is the 6. of <hi>Iohn, And the bread whilk I will giue, is my fleſhe, &amp;c.</hi> This makes nothing for your reall preſence. For firſt, our Sauiour ſpeakes not heere of that Sacramentall eating and drinking, of his fleſh &amp; blood, in this ſermon, whilk was not inſtituted a yeere after that: for he ſpeakes heere of that ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and drinking of his fleſh and blood, without the whilk there is no life. So our Sauiour teſtifies in the 53. verſe, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ye eate</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>the fleſhe of the ſonne of man, and drinke his blood, ye haue no life in you.</hi> But your ſelues graunts that men may be ſaued without that ſacramental eating: therefore it is not of that whilk he ſpeakes heir. Secondly, he ſpeakes of that eating and drinking of his fleſh and blood, whilk who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer ſo doth, hath eternall life to themſelues: ſo our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt promiſes in the 54. verſe. But your owne do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is, that the reprobate eates and drinkes Chriſts body &amp; blood in the ſacrament, and yet hes no life in them: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſpeaks not heere of that ſacramental eating. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, if he ſpeake heere of the ſacramentall eating as you ſay, then your Kirk not onlie hes erred foullie, but alſo hes bene and is the cauſe of the condemnation of your people theſe
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:20312:66"/> manie yeares, becauſe you giue them not his blood to drink And our Sauiour ſayes not onlie, <hi>Except ye eate the fleſh of the ſonne of man,</hi> but alſo, <hi>except ye drink his blood, ye haue no life in you.</hi> And this reaſon was ſo effectuall, that it hes moued ſundrie of your own Doctors to expone this place, not of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall eating and drinking of the bodie &amp; blood of Chriſt,
<note place="margin">As Ianſenius &amp; Tapperus with ſundrie others.</note> but of the ſpirituall eating and drinking of him by faith. For they did ſe that it behoued them either to forſake this place, as not making for them, and graunt that it ſpeakes not of the ſacrament: or elſe to confeſſe that their Kirk hes erred, and through this error, hes bene the cauſe of the damnation of manie, in miniſtring the ſacrament but vnder one kinde. And becauſe you ſay, if our expoſitions were remoued from the Scripture, they would ſerue for you: whome therefore will you credite in exponing of this place? If our Sauiour, heare then howe he expones this eating and drinking of his fleſh and blood in the 35. verſe. <hi>I am the bread of life, hee that commeth vnto me ſhall not hunger, and he that beleeues in me ſhal ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thirſt.</hi> So when we beleeue in Chriſt, we eate him: and when we come vnto him, (whilk is only by faith) we drinke him. So

And if ye will credite none of theſe, then I hope, ye wil not diſcredite your own chief Doctors, who affirmes, <hi>that this place is not meaned of the Sacrament, but of the ſpirituall ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and drinking of Chriſt by faith.</hi> As

                        <hi>Biel, Cuſanus, Caietanus, Heſſelius,</hi> and <hi>Ianſemus.</hi> And if ye wil reply that manie others of the Fathers hes exponed this place of the ſacrament, then <hi>Ianſenius</hi> and <hi>Tapperus</hi> two Papiſts will anſwere you: <hi>That they did it only by way of application vnto the readers and hearers, to ſtirre them vp to the often receiuing of the Sacrament.</hi> So this place can ſerue nothing for your Tranſubſtantiation, for it ſpeaks not of the ſacrament, but of his ſuffering vpon the Croſe for the away taking of our ſinnes, and the purchaſing to vs of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life.</p>
                     <p>The next place ye quote, is the words of the inſtitution,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:20312:67"/> as <hi>Matthew, Marke, Luke,</hi> and the Apoſt. rehearſes them. Your argument is this: Chriſt calles the bread his fleſhe, (and ſo <hi>Paule</hi>) and the wine his blood: therefore the bread is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in his bodie, and the wine in his blood, the outwarde formes of bread and wine onlie remaining. This is the chiefe and principall ground of your reall preſence and Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation. Whereunto I anſwere: Firſt, there is not a ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable heere that telles vs that the ſubſtance of the bread and wine is tranſ-changed in the bodie and blood of Chriſt, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ye will expone this word, <hi>is my bodie,</hi> for, it is changed in my bodie,
<note place="margin">Eſt &amp; Fieri, ſunt contraria</note> whilk is a monſtrous expoſition: for both it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the natiue ſignification of the worde <hi>est;</hi> that ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies to be alreadie: (for to be alreadie, and to be in a change are contrarie) as alſo it hes not the like forme of ſpeache in the whole Scripture to vvarrand it: from the firſt of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> to the laſt of the <hi>Reuelation.</hi> (Bring one inſtance if yee can.) And <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayes,
<note place="margin">Auguſt. in Geneſ quaeſt 117. in Pſal 105. ſupr. Num. quaeſt 95.</note> 
                        <hi>the ſolution of a queſtion ſhould be warranted by ſome example of the like ſpeache in the Scripture,</hi> the whilk you are not able to do: therfore your expoſition is without war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand. Next I ſay: By what arte of reaſoning can you gather this doctrine out of theſe places of Scripture? Chriſt ſayes of the breade, <hi>This is my bodie,</hi> and of the wyne, <hi>This is my bloode.</hi> Therefore the outwarde formes of the breade and wyne on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie remaines, but the ſubſtance of them is gone. Neuer ſik a inkling in all theſe texts of this doctrine of yours. Thirdlie, this interpretation and doctrine whilk reſults vpon it, is fals, and that for theſe reaſons. Firſt, becauſe it is plainely gaine-ſaide by the Scripture. Secondly, becauſe it deſtroyes ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie articles of our faith, and many blaſphemous abſurdities doth follow vpon it. 3. It deſtroyes the nature of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And laſt of all, is vtterly repugnant to the words of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inſtitution. My argument then is this. That interpretation &amp; doctrine whilk is gaine-ſaide, by the plaine teſtimonie of the Scripture, whilk deſtroyes the articles of our faith, and the fundamentall poyntes of our ſaluation, whilk hes many ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities following vpon it, whilk ouerthrovves the nature of the Sacrament, and laſt of all, vvhilk is contrarie to the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:20312:67"/> whole inſtitution, muſt be falſe, blaſphemous and erroneous. This cannot be denyed but your interpretation of theſe wordes <hi>this is my bodye &amp;c.</hi> and your tranſubſtantiation whilk ye gather vpon it, is ſik. Therefore it muſt be errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous &amp;c. My aſſumption I proue thus. Firſt your interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is gainſaide by the plaine teſtimony of the Scripture. Your interpretation is that there remaines no true bread nor wine in the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but the ſubſtance of it is changed. But <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew, Mark, Luke.</hi> and the Apoſtles all foure teſtifies that <hi>Chriſt tooke bread, brake it, &amp; gaue it to his Diſciples,</hi> &amp; leaſt ye ſhuld ſay y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was true bread &amp; wine before the conſecration,
<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.16,</note> but not after, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcripture ſaies planely <hi>that it is bread</hi> whilk we <hi>brake,</hi> &amp; <hi>bread whilk is eaten, and the frute of the Vine whilk is drunken</hi> in the ſacrament. The Apoſtles ſaies, <hi>the bread whilk we brake &amp;c. And as oft as ye eate this bread &amp;c. Whoſoeuer ſhall eate this bread &amp;c. And let a man examine him ſelfe, and ſo let him eate of this bread &amp;c.</hi> And our Sauiour ſayes, that after he had giuen the cup and they had drunken of it, <hi>from hence forth ſhall I not drink of the frutes of the wine with you &amp;c.</hi> Therefore true bread and wine remaines in the ſacrament, contrarie expreſly to your interpretation. 2. That your interpretation deſtroyes the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of our faith, I proue it thus. If this be true that the bread and wine be really changed in the bodie and blood of Chriſt in the ſacrament, as ye expound the words: firſt it will followe that either Chriſt aſcended not into heauen, becauſe he remayneth in the earth in the ſacrament: and ſo one of the articles of our beleefe is falſified. Or els, if ye ſay he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended once, but yet diſcends continually to be preſent in the ſacrament, then another article of our beleefe is falſified whilk ſaith, <hi>that he ſitteth at the right hand of God his father.</hi>

Fourthly it will follow that the body and blood of Chriſt are ſeparate, as the bread and wine in the ſacrament whilk is turned in them is ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Fifthly it will follow that his body is ſeparate from his ſoule, and ſo a dead bodie, becauſe the bread and wine are not changed in his ſoule, but only in his bodie. Sextly it will followe that the breade in the firſt ſupper being changed in the bodie of Chriſt, that the ſubſtance of the bread hes ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for vs, died for vs, and riſen againe for vs: and hes a part of our redemption, whilk is blaſphemous to think. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenthly, it will follow that Chriſt eated his owne bodie and dranke his owne bloode whilk is abſurde:
<note place="margin">Hom. 83. in Mat. De conſecr diſt 2 canon.

As to the fourth, that it is againſt the whole inſtitution, and vſe thereof, I proue it thus. Firſt, I will aske you what was it whilk Chriſt tooke in his hand? if you ſay his fleſh, then the text will ſay the contrarie, <hi>And Ieſus tooke bread,</hi> in all the three Euangeliſts, and the Apoſtle <hi>Paule.</hi> So it was bread whilk he tooke, after he did take it, he bliſſed it: what did he bliſſe? but the bread whilk he had taken: ſo it is yet bread: after he bliſſed it, he brake it: what did he break?

After he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen it they receiued it, and did eate it. But what did they eate? But that whilk he gaue: and therefore the Apoſtle ſaies foure times, It is bread whilk is eaten, and vvhereof vve are partakers, and that after the conſecration: for it is broken, giuen and receiued, and eaten, after the conſecration. And when they did eate it, he ſaide, This is my bodie, what did he call his bodie but that whilk they did eate, and that was bread. So when then, Maiſter <hi>Gilbert,</hi> ſhould this change
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:20312:69"/> be? ſeing it is bread al the time while he tooke it, bleſſed it, and gaue it, and they did eate. For, I trow, ye will not ſay it is changed after it is broken, and giuen, and in eating. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condlie, I will aske you, what are the wordes whereby this monſtrous change is made, as ye ſuppoſe, of the ſubſtance of the bread, in Chriſts bodie? If this change be made by anie word ſpoken in the inſtitution of this Sacrament: then, I ſay it muſt either be by this word: <hi>And he bliſſed it:</hi> or by theſe words, <hi>This is my bodie, &amp;c.</hi> But not by the firſt: for after he bliſſed it, he called it bread. And the Apoſtle ſayes it is bread whilk wee brake, therefore it remaines bread after the bliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. Not by the other words: for if they be not ſpoken to the breade and wine, they cannot change their nature: But <hi>Marke</hi> ſayes plainly they were ſpoken to the Diſciples, <hi>And he ſaide vnto them, This is my blood:</hi>

                        </note> therefore they changed not their nature. And <hi>Durand</hi> a Papiſt ſaies, <hi>that this change is made by the bleſsing,</hi> therefore not by theſe words whilk were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced after the bleſsing. And theſe words cannot worke a change:
<note place="margin">Geneſ. Ioh. 12</note> for they are not words importing an operation as theſe are, <hi>Let light be: let the earth bring forth fruit, come out Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> and ſik-like: but onlie ſignifying the things themſelues, as theſe are, <hi>Thou art my welbeloued Sonne.</hi> So if theſe wordes ſhoulde haue wrought anie change, they woulde not haue bene <hi>This is my body &amp;c.</hi> but Let this be my bodie: therefore there is no ſik change at all heir as ye imagine. Thirdlie, it ſhould followe that the Cup ſhould alſo be changed in his blood, and in the new Teſtament, becauſe Chriſt calles the Cup his blood and newe Teſtament, as he calles the bread his bodie. But this you will not ſay: wherefore then are you ſo abſurd as to ſay the other. Fourthlie, I will aske you whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do ye receaue in the Sacrament that body whilk is mor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tall, or that body whilk is glorified: for one of them you muſt receaue: either Chriſts bodie as it was mortal, or his body as it is now glorified. If ye ſay a mortall bodie, then I ſay Chriſt hes not a mortall bodie to giue you now in the Sacrament, for it is glorified: therefore ye cannot receiue it: if ye ſay an immortall and glorified bodie, then I ſay, ye muſt ſeeke an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:20312:70"/> warrand nor this text of <hi>Matthew, Mark,</hi> and <hi>Luke.</hi> For at that time his bodie was not glorified. For the Sacrament was inſtituted before his death, and he was not glorified vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till after his reſurrection: and if ye receiue that ſame body whilk the Apoſtles then receiued: then, ye receiue not a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified body. What a body is this then whilk ye receiue, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mortall nor glorified? Fifthlie, the text ſayes, they <hi>who receiues vnworthelie, receiues their owne damnation:</hi> But if Chriſtes fleſh and blood were there preſent, as ye ſay: then al who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued it ſhould receiue their ſaluation, becauſe our Sauiour ſayes,
<note place="margin">Ioh. 6.54</note> 
                        <hi>He that eates my fleſhe and drinke, my blood hath lyfe euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting.</hi> Now I conclude, ſeing your interpretation of theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture, and your doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation whilk ye gather thereupon, firſt is plainlie gain-ſaide by the expreſſe teſtimonies of the Scripture, next ouerthrowes all the maine foundations of our ſaluation, and articles of our faith: thirdlie deſtroyes the nature of a Sacrament and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it no Sacrament at all, and like no other Sacrament ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the olde or new Teſtament, and laſt of all is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the whole inſtitution thereof, as, I hope, I haue ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entlie prooued: therefore of neceſsitie it muſt be falſe &amp; er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous.</p>
                     <p>As for the 10. of the <hi>Corinth.</hi> 16. <hi>The Cup of bliſsing whilk wee bliſſe, is it not the communication, and the bread whilk we breake, is it not &amp;c.</hi> I anſwere: this Sacrament of bread and wine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it not onlie repreſents and ſeales vp to vs our commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion both with Chriſt: but alſo by it, as by a moſt effectual inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the holy Ghoſt increaſes &amp; nouriſhes this communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, both with him, and amongſt our ſelues: therefore it is called the communication of his bodie and blood. But this moſt clearlie proues, that there is no ſik change heir as ye ſuppoſe: for the Apoſt. ſayes plainlie, <hi>the bread whilk we break,</hi> and this breaking you ſay is after the conſecration: therfore after the conſecration true bread remains in the Sacrament and ſo there is no Tranſubſtantiation in the ſame. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you ſay the ſubſtance of the bread &amp; wine is not there I pray you tell me whither are they gone? whether are they
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:20312:70"/> turned to nothing, or are they changed in Chriſts bodie. If you ſay they are turned to nothing: firſte, I ſay this were a ſtrange kinde of reaſoning: <hi>This is my bodie,</hi> therefore the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the bread is turned to nothing: next the Apoſtle ſhould not ſpeake truelie, to call it <hi>bread whilk is broken, and bread whilk is eaten, &amp;c.</hi> if it were turned to nothing. Thirdly then this ſhould not be called Tranſubſtantiation, or chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of one ſubſtance into another: but an annihilation of one ſubſtance, that is, a turning of it to nothing, and a bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of another ſubſtance in the roome of it. And fourthly <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquine,</hi>

                        </note> your great defender of this doctrine is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this. But if you ſay, they are turned in Chriſts bodie, whilk the word Tranſubſtantiation imports: then, I ſay, as oft as the Sacrament hes bene miniſtrated, as oft hes there bene ſome quantitie of ſubſtance ciked to his bodie: and it ſhall ſtill grow in greatnes and quantitie, as long as it ſhall be miniſtred: but this is monſtrous to thinke. And to end this, if you ſay there is no ſubſtance of bread and wine left in the Sacrament, then let me aske you whoſe are the white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and readneſſe, and roundneſſe that we ſee: What meanes this taiſt in our mouthes of bread and wine, if there be no ſubſtance of them there. May we not ſay to you as Chriſt ſaide to <hi>Thomas,</hi> who doubted of his reſurrection, <hi>Put thy finger heir, beholde my handes, put thy hand in my ſide, and be not incredulous but beleeue.</hi> So, may not we ſay to you, who doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth whether the ſubſtance of bread &amp; wine be heir remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning yet, touch them, taiſt them, looke on them, and feele them, and be not incredulous, but beleeue. For beholde, there would not be ſik a coullour, ſik a taiſt and ſmell, and there were not ſubſtance of bread and wine heir. And I pray you tel me what is this that rottes then &amp; growes in Mauks in the bread, and ſowers in the wine, if they be long kept? If their ſubſtance remaineth not, will you ſay Chriſts fleſh and blood rots and conſumes &amp; ſowers, what is this but to mak him mortall, yea to crucifie him againe. And if you will not ſay that, then either muſt you confeſſe that their ſubſtance remaines and is not changed, or els Chriſts fleſh and blood
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:20312:71"/> is tranſubſtantiated in theſe ſubſtances whilk rots &amp; ſowres, or els that the accidents is changed againe in their ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: &amp; ſo ye ſhall not haue one, but maa changes in your Sacrament. Yea, if their ſubſtance be gone, and nothing but their accidents remaining, then how could Pope <hi>Victor</hi> the 3. and the Emperour <hi>Henrie</hi> the 7. haue bene poyſoned with them,
<note place="margin">Faſciculus temp.

So we ſee the textes ye brought with you, is againſt you as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſword that <hi>Goliah</hi> brought to ſlay <hi>Dauid,</hi> cutted off his owne head. But yet you wil ſay, If the bread be not his bodie, why then did he call it his bodie: this is the chiefe thing you haue for your doctrine, and anſwere this, and the plea is wonne.

But we ſay to you pretend not his omnipotencie for your monſtrous imaginations, whilk hes no warrand of his will in his Scripture. For firſt we ſay, this argument of yours will not follow: Chriſt is able to make his bodie to be in two places, both at once, in heauen, and in the Sacrament: therefore he makes it to be ſo. For you muſt firſt proue he wil doe ſo: for your ſelf, Maiſter <hi>Gilbert,</hi> can do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things quhilk you doe not, becauſe you will not, ſo from can to wil, it followes not.

And ſeeing your Kirk grants that the eating of Chriſt corporally does no good, and the eating of him by faith only will bring eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, as our Sauiour ſayes: what needs then this corporall and reall eating of Chriſt?

But there was no bodie deliuered for vs, but the naturall bodie of Chriſt: there<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore it was his naturall bodie that he gaue to his Diſciples to be eaten. Then if it were his naturall bodie, it was not natural bread.

Vpon the whilk I reaſon thus, this propoſition is true, <hi>this is my bodie whilk is broken for you.</hi> So the Apoſtle ſayes, but Chriſts bodie was not broken then reallie, for not a bone of him was broken at all, as the Scripture teſtifies:
<note place="margin">Exod 12. Ioh, 19,</note> and the Scripture ſayes and all men confeſſes that he ſuffered but once, ſo only his ſufferings ar ſignified then by the breaking of the bread in the ſacrament here: ſo as Chriſts bodie was not broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then reallie, that is, ſuffered: but his ſuffering only ſignified by the breaking of the bread, ſo his bodie was not giuen reallie and corporallie to be eaten, but only ſignified. Secondly, I ſay, it is true, that Chriſts naturall bodie was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered to the death for vs: but yet it will not followe vpon this, that it was his naturall bodie whilk hee gaue to them to be eaten corporallie: for his naturall bodie was reallie deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to death for vs: and it was but giuen to them ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie to be eaten. You muſte coyne a newe Logick M. <hi>Gilbert</hi> or you can make theſe two ſticke together: and the one ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarilie to follow vpon the other. For by that ſame reaſon
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:20312:74"/> you may aſwell conclude, that Chriſt gaue his naturall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to be eaten corporallie in the worde, for hee giues him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to
<note n="a)" place="margin">Ioh. 6.35 Bellarm grants this alſo lib. 1. de Euchariſt. cap. 7.</note> be eaten in his worde aſwell as in his Sacrament, and alſo he giues that ſame body to them in the word, whilk was deliuered to death: for the ſelfe ſame Chriſte is offered and receiued aſwell in the worde as in the Sacrament. So from his bodilie death, to a corporal eating of him, it wil not follow. And further by that ſame reaſon you may aſwell ſay that the fathers before Chriſt vnder the law, did eate Chriſts bodie corporallie, for they eate that ſame ſpirituall foode, &amp; drank that ſame ſpirituall drink, in their Sacraments, whilk we doe now in ours. So the Apoſtle teſtifies, euen that ſelfe ſame Chriſt his bodie and blood whiilk was deliuered to the death, &amp; yet it wil not follow, that they did eate his naturall bodie &amp;c. As for <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> it is true he ſo ſpeakes: but hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundes himſelfe in that ſame chapter, while as he ſayes, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the bleſsing another forme or thing is named, but after the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration the bodie of Chriſt is ſignified:</hi> If the bread then ſignifie the bodie of Chriſt, it is not changed in his body. And becauſe of this holy vſe to ſignify the body of Chriſt, <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſayes that <hi>the nature is changed by bleſsing:</hi> and that this is his meaning his words following will declare it, where he ſayes. <hi>Shall not the words of Chriſt be of force to change the forme of the Elements.</hi>

                     <p>As for the 7 point of your doctrine concerning the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of hands in the ordination of the lawful miniſters of the Kirk of Chriſt, becauſe it is a ceremony whilk hes the foundation of it in the worde of God, and was practiſed in the primitiue Kirk, as in the ordination of <hi>Timothie</hi> here, and others: and is profitable both to put the Paſtors in minde of his calling, that he is ſeparated of God for the diſcharge of the ſame, and alſo the people that they imbrace him as one ſent of God to them, therefore we both acknowledge it and practiſe it. But that either the gift of the holy Ghoſt is inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably ioyned with it, or that it is a ſacrament of the newe Teſtament properly (as you affirme) that we denie. As to the firſt, the gift of the holye Ghoſt is not inſeparablie ioyned with it, firſt, becauſe that is iniurious to the Lords free grace, whilk is not bound to any inſtrument, let be to a ceremonie. And alſo he ſpeakes againſt experience: for how many, I pray you, doe receiue impoſition of hands, who receiues not a new grace and gift of the holy Ghoſt amongſt you? Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable experience theſe many ages both doth teſtifie it,
<note place="margin">Ex veteri Teſta. queſt 109. inter opera Auguſtini.</note> and alſo one hes teſtified the ſame, ſaying, <hi>our Preiſts doth lay the word of bleſſing vppon many, but in fewe followeth the effect of that bleſſing.</hi> And certainly if any gift of the holy Ghoſt is ioyned with this ceremonie, it ſhould be an abilitie to preach the word: for that is the principall part of the office of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Goſpel. But how many thouſands are they among you in your Kirk wholes receiued this impoſition of hands, and yet as vnable to preach the Goſpel as Aſſes are? and laſt of all, what needed that <hi>tryall and examination,</hi> ſo ſtraightlie commanded in the Scripture, whilk ought to be had of them that are to be ordained, if the holy Ghoſt were euer inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rablie
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:20312:79"/> giuen with the ceremonie. For wherefore is this triall and examination? And wherefore is <hi>Timothie</hi> ſo ſtraightlie charged to <hi>lay his hands ſuddenlie on no man,</hi> but becauſe it is onlie the holy Ghoſt who enables. The whilk alſo ſhould be well knowne vnto his Kirk ere they preſume to teſtifie the calling of God to them. For if it were true that ye ſay that the gift of the holy Ghoſt were ioyned with the impoſition of hands inſeparablie,
<note place="margin">1. Timoth. 5.22</note> then the Apoſtle ſhould rather haue commanded <hi>Timothie</hi> to lay his hands vpon manie in reſpect of the neede that the Kirk ſtoode in of all men, rather then to haue diſcharged him. And as for the place of <hi>Paule</hi> whilk ye cite here, <hi>Deſpiſe not the gift &amp;c.</hi> This ſerues nothing for your doctrine: for if firſt the gift giuen to <hi>Timothie</hi> whilk the Apoſtles ſpeake of, was extraordinarie, and ſo ordinarilie doth not euer follow the ceremonie. 2. It is not aſcriued heere to the ceremonie of impoſition of handes, but vnto Prophecy, <hi>whilk is giuen thee by Prophecie,</hi> wherby it was reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the Kirk of the abilitie of this man. And ſo if there be anie prophecies that goes of you in your Clergie that the holie Ghoſt is giuen to you, then ye may claime vnto the ſame: but I think ye will not ſay that ſik like prophecies go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of you: therefore yee cannot claime to this teſtimonie. 3.
<note place="margin">2. Tim. 1.14</note> 
                        <hi>Timothie</hi> is exhorted <hi>to keepe that worthie thing concredited vnto him through the holie Ghoſt.</hi> It was the holie Ghoſt therefore who was the giuer and preſeruer of it. And as for the ceremonie it was a ſigne of the preſence of gods ſpirit in them who was lawfully ordained. Now as to the ſecond that ye will haue it a ſacrament, becauſe it hes a externall forme, and alſo a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of grace. That will not follow: for then you ſhould haue innumerable Sacraments: for prayer, almouſ-deeds, and the ordination of Magiſtrates, and manye other hes external formes, and hes promiſes of grace ioyned with them: and yet you will not ſay, that they are properlie Sacraments. For in all the Sacraments of the new Teſtament whilk properly are Sacraments, there muſt bee firſte not onlye an externall action but an earthlie and viſible Element, as water in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, and breade and wyne in the Supper. And therefore,

                        <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayes <hi>let the word be ioyned with the element,</hi>

                        <hi>and then it is a ſacrament.</hi> Secondly, they muſt haue their expres warrant and inſtitution from Ieſus Chriſt in the Scripture, as baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me hes <hi>Math.</hi> 28. and the Lords ſupper hes <hi>Math.</hi> 26. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they muſt not only haue a promiſe of grace, but a promiſe of remiſsion of ſinnes and ſanctification: for they muſt bee ſeales of that couenant whilke is common to all Chriſtians, as baptiſme and the Lords ſupper is. But this ceremonie of impoſition of hands wants all theſe three: for neither is there any earthly element, neither ſeales it vp the couenant whilk is common to al, but proper to the miniſtrie only: neither hes it the expres inſtitution of Chriſt in al the foure Euangeliſts. and whereas in the 20. of <hi>Iohn</hi> he there ordaines his Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, we read, he <hi>breathed on them,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>receiue the holy Ghoſt.</hi> but not a word that he laid his hands on them, or comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to vſe it to others. The whilk without all queſtion he would haue done, if he had ordained it to be a ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: and <hi>Petrus a Soto</hi> a Papiſt ſaies, that the making of the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of hands to be a ſacrament, is a tradition. Therefore it is not a ſacrament properly of the new Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Secondly, if the ordination of any by impoſition of hands were a ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the ordination of a biſhop by the ſame eſpecially, ſhuld be a ſacrament: for the place whilk ye quote here is of <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie</hi> who was a Biſhop as your Kirk affirmes.

As for <hi>Caluine</hi> &amp; <hi>Melanchton,</hi> they cal it a ſacrament taking the worde in an ample ſenſe, for theſe ceremonies that hes the foundation in the word: whilk hes a promiſe of a bleſſing ioyned with them: and not in that ſenſe that bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme and the Lords ſupper are called ſacraments, as <hi>Caluine</hi> in that firſt place whilk ye quote plainly acknowledges: for theſe are his wordes, <hi>Let the Chriſtian Kirk (ſayes he) be content of theſe, (meaning of baptiſme and the ſupper) and let them not admit nor acknowledge, deſire, or look for, any other third ſacrament til the end of the world. And as for impoſition of hands whilk the Kirk vſes in their ordinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, he ſaies, I wil not be againſt it that it be called a ſacrament, ſo being I reckon it not among the ordinarie ſacraments.</hi> And <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanchton</hi> in that ſame place reckons vp prayer, almes, marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, the Magiſtrat in the number of theſe vnto the whilks he giues this name of a ſacrament, whereby he makes it plaine that he takes this worde <hi>ſacrament,</hi> amply and larglie as hes bene ſaide before, and not in that ſenſe that baptiſme and the ſupper is called ſacraments. So you play your ſelfe (Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Gilbert</hi>) in the ambiguitie of this word ſacrament, and deceiues the reader with the ſame. And whereas ye call your Prieſts the only lawfull Miniſters now a dayes: I wil anſwer to this more fullie afterward, onlie this now: Firſt, ſeing the fountaine and grounde vpon the whilk all the lawfull cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linges in your Kirk depends and is deriued, as your ſelues confeſſes, is the ſupremacy of your Pope, whome I haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to be the Antichriſt in my other treatiſe, and ſeeing the office of your prieſthoode in ſacrificing the ſonne of God, as ye ſuppoſe, is moſt abhominable, idolatrous and Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,

For if Marriage be not a Sacrament, then the bonde may be lowſed by their owne doctrine. But marriage is not a Sacrament, as ſhall be proued heereafter: Therefore the bonde is ſoluble. Our doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine is, that the bonde of marriage contracted and perfited betweene two Chriſtians, is broken by the adulterie of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the parties: ſo that the innocent diuorced, maye law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully marry another. As for our doctrine. It is plaine in the Scripture, in the 19. and 5. of <hi>Matthew:</hi> where there the Lord in plaine tearmes excepts the cauſe of fornication, ſaying: <hi>Whoſoeuer dimits his wife except it be for fornication, and marries an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, commits adulterie.</hi> So then by the contrarie: hee that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits his wife for fornicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (whilk is adulterie there) &amp; mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries another, commits not adulterie. And ſeeing the Apoſtle commands,
<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7.2.</note> 
                        <hi>That euerie man haue his owne wife, and euerie wife her owne husband, and that for the auoyding of fornication: and it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to marrie nor to burne.</hi> Therfore, the firſt marriage being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued by diuorcement iuſtly, according to gods worde; It is leaſome to the partie innocent at leaſt, to vſe the remedie of marriage for the auoyding of fornication. Other-wiſe, if hee might not vſe it, diuorcement were not a benefite, but rather a puniſhment, and the innocent ſhoulde be puniſhed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a fault.</p>
                     <p>Now, as to the Scriptures whilk ye quote, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.6. and 5.31. they haue that exception of <hi>fornication</hi> expreſlie mentioned. And as for the places of <hi>Mark.</hi> 10.11.12. and <hi>Luke</hi> 16.18. and <hi>Romanes</hi> 7.2.3. and 1. <hi>Corinth,</hi> 7.39. they are
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:20312:81"/> all to be vnderſtood with that exception of <hi>fornication,</hi> that our Sauiour expreſlie ſets downe in the former two places, otherwaies Scripture ſhould be contrary to Scripture, whilk is blaſphemie to thinke, and our Sauiour is the beſt exponer of himſelfe. And as for the 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 7.10.11. the Apoſtle ſpeakes not of that ſeparation for adulterie, but of a ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for a ſeaſon, for other cauſes or variances, in the whilk eaſe the parties ſeparated, are to remaine vnmaried, or to be reconciled together.

                        </note> The 9. point of your doctrine is: you will haue <hi>Marriage a Sacrament of the newe Teſtament, and that properlie, and that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the inſtitution of God, vnto the whilk the promiſe of the grace of iuſtification is annexed:</hi> ſo <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and the councell of Trent ſaies. But marke (Chriſtian reader) their ground of this their doctrine. They ſay, the bond of marriage amongſt infidels may be broken: but ſay they the bond of marriage amongſt the faithfull cannot be broken. And they make the cauſe of this difference to be this, becauſe the marriage of Chriſtians is a Sacrament. So they reaſon. Marriage amongſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans is a Sacrament: therefore ſay they, it cannot be broken. But what is their principal ground now, wherby they proue marriage to be a Sacrament? becauſe (ſay they) the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of Chriſtians is a bond indiſſoluble; therefore it is a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament whilk hes the grace of Iuſtification ioyned with it. So mutuallie, one error vpholds another. Vpon the whilk I reaſon: If the bond of marriage may be broken for adultery then it cannot be a Sacrament: (this your Kirk graunts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they make that the ground of this) but the bonde of marriage may be broken for adulterie, as hath bene proued before, both by the Scriptures, &amp; alſo by your owne canons, councels, Doctors, and Popes: therefore marriage is not a Sacrament.</p>
                     <p>Secondlie, in the ſacraments of the new Teſtament, there
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:20312:82"/> are earthlie elements: as the water in Baptiſme: the bread and wine in the ſupper: and an expreſſe forme of words pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriued in the newe Teſtament: as in Baptiſme, <hi>I bapitze thee, &amp;c.</hi> and in the Supper, <hi>This is my bodie &amp;c. Matth.</hi> 26. They haue their expreſſe inſtitution by Chriſt in the ſame, and hes the promiſes of remiſsion of ſinnes and iuſtification annexed to them. But none of theſe things are to be had in marriage. Firſt, no earthlie element: next, no forme preſcriued in the word of God: thirdlie, no expreſſe inſtitution of it as of a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament: fourthlie, no promiſe of the remiſsion of ſinnes and ſaluation annexed vnto it. Therefore it cannot be a ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the new Teſtament properlie.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, if marriage were a ſacrament, and ſik a ſacrament that ſignified and gaue the grace of iuſtification with it,
<note place="margin">Bellarm. lib. 1, de matrim, cap. 5 pag. 67</note> that is, remiſsion of ſinnes: then wherefore ſhould your Kirk for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid all your Cleargie from the ſame? and wherefore ſhoulde ye abſtaine from that ſacrament, whilk is inſtituted of God, to giue remiſsion of ſinnes to you, and to make you accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God, as your doctrine ſayes. Why ſhoulde yee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue your ſelf of that thing whilk may place you in Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uour, and purchaſe to you remiſsion of ſinnes, (as ye ſay ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage may doe) it is a token that either ye beleeue not your owne doctrine, or elſe preferres whoredome and adulterie, whilk is condemned of God, to marriage whilk is Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance and honorable amongſt all men.</p>
                     <p>Fourthlie, I ſay, if the marriage of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eua</hi> in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, and the marriage of all the Patriarckes, &amp; Prophets, and Prieſts, and people in the olde Teſtament, was not a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, neither is the marriage of Chriſtians in the new te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament a ſacrament. For they were ſymboles that repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented our ſpirituall coniunction with Chriſt, aſwell as the marriage of Chriſtians in the new teſtament does: the whilk you will not deny. And Pope <hi>Leo</hi> ſayes,

                        <hi>That marriage was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted from the beginning, that they might haue in themſelues a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Chriſt, and his Kirk:</hi> but the firſte you graunt your ſelues was not a Sacrament? therefore neither is the ſecond a ſacrament.</p>

And ſurely if in any one poynt of your doctrine, you ſhewe your ſelues to be men, who not onlie knowes not the holines of God, the vnſpeakablenes of that other life, the perfection and infinite vertue of Chriſts me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, the perfection of his law, and mans infirmitie and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; eſpecially you manifeſt it in this point, for if ye knew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of theſe thinges, ye would neuer profeſſe ſuch damnable doctrine: for that our workes may merite eternall life (as ye ſay) and that not onely in reſpect of the couenant, but in reſpect of the worke it ſelfe there are fiue thinges required. 1. That the work be perfit according to that meaſure of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection whilk the law of God requires, and the whole lawe muſt be fulfilled, and that perfitlie and continuallie. 2. The workes muſt not be debt, that is, ſik workes as we are bound before to doe; for the paying of that duty whilk we owe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie cannot merite properly a rewarde: for will you ſay that for the paying of that whilk you owe alreadie you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue a reward? 3. There muſt be a proportion and equality betweene the worke wrought and the rewarde it ſelfe, for if the worke be leſſe and the reward greater, then that whilk is more then the work is not of merite but of liberalitie. 4. The perſons to whome the worke is done muſt be obliſhed and bound by right to rander and recompence the worker for the worthines of the worke, ſo that he is not iuſt and he do it not. And laſt of all the worke muſt be our owne and not an others, and the power our owne whereby it is done and not an others, or we can be ſaide properly to merite by the ſame. But all theſe conditions will faile in our workes: therefore they cannot bee meritorious of eternall life. For as to the

So theſe Scriptures ſerues you to no purpoſe. For the controuerſie betwixt vs is not whether there is a rewarde promiſed, and whether it ſhalbe randered accordingly to the ſame, for that we graunt: but whether this reward is of merite or of grace.

And here (reader) I am compelled to ſpeake this to thee ſuppoſe thou beleeue not that they haue written and will maintaine ſo horrible blaſphemies I wonder not: for I ſpeak the truth to thee in my conſcience I lye not, I could not haue bene induced my ſelf to haue beleeued that euer they durſt haue profeſſed ſik damnable and deuiliſh doctrine and I had not red it my ſelf in their owne bookes, yea I durſt not haue bene ſo confident as to haue ſet it downe here vpon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of anie, except I had red it my ſelfe.

To anſwer you then, firſt if we be not able to performe all the duties whilk God requires of vs in his law,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:20312:87"/> then we are not able to doe workes of ſupererogation whilk is more then our duty, commanded in the law, as ye ſay.

Thirdlie, what an abſurd and blaſphemous thing is this to ſay, that God hes not commanded to vs the workes of greateſt perfection, (for Maiſter <hi>Gilbert</hi> calles theſe, workes of greater perfection) and ſo ſik workes wherein he is moſte glorified: but hes left them in our owne choiſe to doe, or not to do, as though the Lord had not commanded vs to glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him in the greateſt perfection, nor yet we were bound to doe the ſame? Fourthlie, if there be any ſik works of ſupere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation whilk are of greater perfection nor the Law com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands: then it ſhould followe, that the vowe of continency, wilfull pouertie, and monaſticall obedience to their ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, ſhould be works of greater perfection, and ſo pleaſe God more, then the loue of God with all the hart, with al the ſoule, with all the ſtrength, with all the minde,

Fifthlie, this was only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the ſonne of God to fulfill the Law of God perfitelie, and to doe more then the Lawe required: to wit, to die for vs who were his enemies: this doctrine therefore of yours ſpoiles him of this his glorie. Laſt of all, if none can merite eternall life through their workes at all: then none can aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment their glorie and rewarde in heauen by their workes of ſupererogation. But the firſt I haue proued before: therfore the other muſt followe. And marke this (reader) how farre God hes blinded their mindes: for they deride, &amp; they mock at that imputation of the righteouſneſſe &amp; merites of Chriſt,

                        </note> and they pronounce them accurſed that ſo thinkes: but yet they teach that the works of ſupererogation whilk men does
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:20312:88"/> may be communicate to others. As for the firſt place whilk ye quote <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. <hi>If thou wilt be perfite, &amp;c.</hi> I anſwered to it before, in my anſwere to the ſecond point of your doctrine: to the whilk I referre the reader. And ſo your wilfull pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie hes no ground heir. For if this man did not perfitely ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the Lawe, then was he not able to doe more then the law required of him: but the firſt is true as I proued before in the ſecond point of your doctrine, and as the circumſtances of the text teſtifies it, for he went away ſad, and he put his truſt in his riches: and ſo it was not onlie difficile, but impoſsible for him to enter in the kingdome of God, as our Sauiour ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, whilk had not beene true of him, if he had fulfilled the Lawe. And this was a ſpeciall command to this man, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer his hypocriſie. And all Chriſtians is bound alſo out of the loue of their heart to Chriſt, to be content to forſake all that they haue before we renounce him, or his worde, when he ſo requireth of vs. And if wilfull pouertie be ſik a worke of perfection as ye thinke,
<note place="margin">Pro. 30.8</note> wherefore then would the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet haue praied, <hi>Giue me neither pouertie nor riches, but feede mee with foode conuenient.</hi> And if this be the worke of greateſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, what is the cauſe that your Abbots, Popes, Biſhops, &amp; Cardinals (for who ſhould be perfite if not theſe?) will not ſell al their reuenues whilk they haue, wherein they ſurmou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the princes of the world, and ſo augment their glory in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and be perfite? But ſhall others beleeue and obey this doctrine of yours, when the greateſt Patrons of it, beleeues and obeyes it not? O hypocrites who will beleue you!</p>
                     <p>As for the next work of ſupererogation, <hi>Virginitie:</hi> it is true that the Virgine and vn-married, who hes the gift of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie, thinks vpon the things that appertaines to God: and it is true, that if any haue the gift of continency, it is better to be vn-married, then to marrie, eſpeciallie in the times of perſecution. But yet it followes not that it is a work of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erogation: for to them who lies the gift, it is a commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for he that hes the gift is commanded to vſe it, and in loſing it, he ſinnes. And euery man is bound to glorify God to the vttermoſt of his power, and God is moſt glorified by
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:20312:88"/> the ſingle life of theſe, eſpeciallie in the time of perſecution, who hes the gift: and ſo it is not a counſell ſimplie but alſo a command, but to them onlie who hes the gift, &amp; that ſo long onelie as they haue the gift. And the Apoſtle ſayes in that ſame place whilk ye quote heir, that he thinks he hes the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of God alſo, and ſo this iudgement of his was the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſpirite of God, whilk binds and obliſhes al them who hes the gift.

And ſince you ſay it is better, wherefore make ye Matrimonie a Sacrament to giue remiſsion of ſins? For ſhall not a Sacrament whilk giues remiſsion of ſinnes be better then an indifferent action, whilk men may doe, or leaue vndone, ſik as ye ſay Virginitie is? As for the Apoſtles example 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 9. in preaching the Goſpel freelie without wages to them: I anſwere: ſuppoſe it was leeſome to him, &amp; all the Miniſters of the Goſpell, to haue taken wages, as him ſelf teſtifies and proues in that ſame chapter, from the 4. ver. to the 15. yet it was not expedient to him for the courſe of the Goſpell amongſt them. And men are not only comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to abſtaine from that whilk is vnleeſome, but alſo from the things whilk are leeſome, if they be not expedient: and ſo he did no more heir then he ſhould haue done.

<note place="margin">Ver. 18</note> 
                        <hi>That I abuſe not my au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie in the Goſpell:</hi> but this would haue bene an abuſe of his liberty with his people: therfore he was bound to doe it.

<note place="margin">Lib. 4 de Chriſto cap 6</note> 
                        <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confeſſes that this article was not in the Creede with all Kirkes, as hee proues there by the teſtimonies of <hi>Irenaeus, Origen, Tertullian,</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> who all exponed the Creede. And <hi>Auguſtine</hi> exponed it fiue times, and yet neuer mentions this article.

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:20312:90"/> in all the points of your doctrine. Nowe as to the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture whilk ye quote, they ſerue nothing to this purpoſe. For the 2. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> it ſpeakes of that bondage of the graue whilk kept him vnder vntill he roſe againe: and therefore the Greek word is <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>; whilk ſignifieth death, and not hell, as ye tranſlate it heir: and <hi>Peter</hi> ſayes, <hi>whome God raiſed vp.</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeakes then of that part of Chriſt whilk had falne and was raiſed vp: but it was the body only and not the ſoule whilk fell downe and was raiſed vp: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſpeakes of the ſorrowes of death whereby his bodie was kept in bondage, and not of anye locall deſcenſion of Chriſts ſoule. As for the places of the <hi>Pſalmes</hi> whilk ye quote heir, <hi>Peter</hi> brings them not in to proue this locall deſcenſion (as ye ſay) whereof he makes no mention: but to proue his reſurrection as he ſayes in the 31. verſe moſt plainly: <hi>He know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this before,</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Dauid, ſpake of the reſurrection of Chriſt, that his ſoule ſhould not remaine in graue, neither his fleſhe ſhoulde ſee corruption.</hi> So, if ye will beleeue the ſpirite of God in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle interpreting theſe places, they ſpeake of the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Chriſt, and not of the deliuering of the ſoule out of hell, for he was in Paradiſe, as he ſayes himſelfe: and it is the bodie that was raiſed, and not the ſoule. And the Hebrewe word is NEPHESCH, whilk not onely ſignifieth the ſoule, but alſo the life, as <hi>Gen</hi> 37.21. <hi>Let vs ſmite his ſoule,</hi> that is, take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his life. And it ſignifieth alſo the body of the dead wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there was life, as <hi>Leuit.</hi> 21. ver. 1. and 11. And this worde hel is SCHEOL in Hebrew, whilk moſt vſuallie is taken in the Scripture for the graue. So then the meaning is this, <hi>The Lord will not leaue his</hi> Nepheſch, that is, the bodie wherein his life was in <hi>Scheol,</hi> that is, in the graue: whilk ſpeach is vſual in the Scripture. Now as to the other Pſalme 29.3. it is ſpoken pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlie of <hi>Dauid,</hi> where hee thankes God who had ſaued his life from the handes of his enemies, whilk by a borrowed ſpeach frequented in the Scripture, is called the deliuery of his ſoule from the graue. As for the 4. of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> Theſe <hi>lower parts of the earth</hi> is not hell, as ye expone it, but the earth it ſelf, whilk in reſpect of the world is the loweſt part: and ſo
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:20312:91"/> it is taken in the 139. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> ver. 15. where <hi>Dauid</hi> ſayes, <hi>Thou hes faſhioned me beneath in the lower parts of the earth,</hi> where heir it is not taken for hell, as you take it in that place of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſians,</hi> otherwiſe you muſt ſay that <hi>Dauid</hi> vvas borne in hell vvhilk I trovv ye vvill not ſay. So heirby is meant then the loweſt and baſeſt degree of his humiliation. So novve to conclude this: neither in theſe points, Maiſter <hi>Gilbert,</hi> nor in any point of doctrine vvherein ye differ from vs, is your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine aggreable to Chriſts doctrine and his Apoſtles, as hes bene (I hope) proued ſufficiently.

                     <p>As for this ground whilk ye alledge to be ours: it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res certainlie, Maiſter <hi>Gilbert,</hi> that as ye ſaide of me, eyther ye know not our grounds, or elſe ye wilfullie invert them for your own aduantage. For our ground is, that nothing ought to be done or beleeued in Religion, but that whilk may bee warranted by the teſtimonie of the ſcripture, either in words &amp; ſenſe together, or elſe by a neceſſary collection out of the ſame. The whilk with <hi>Nazianzene</hi> vve ſay, <hi>are of the ſame trueth and authoritie with the firſt.</hi> And according to this ſenſe vve ſay that all the heades of our Religion, aſvvell negatiue as affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiue, are expreſly contained in the ſcripture, and ſo ought
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:20312:92"/> both to be beleeued and practiſed. Theſe are but ſilly ſhifts, Maiſter <hi>Gilbert,</hi> whilk ye bring to diſcredite the trueth of our religion.

                     <p>As for our abilitie to proue the trueth of our doctrine, I anſwered it before: iudge thou Chriſtian reader of the ſame, by this my anſwere. As for the ſuſpending of his Maieſties acts againſt you, that is not in our hands: and for all the good ye could doe, you haue but too much libertie. And if you ſpeake no better for your religion, nor ye haue done elſe in this your anſwere, your Kirk will be but little beholden to you for it. And certainlie if you will binde and obliſhe your ſelfe to face your owne cauſe, and defend your religion by word, I hope that licence of a ſafe paſſage &amp; conduct would be graunted to you by his Maieſtie, to let you ſpeak for your ſelfe, what ye haue for you for the defence of it, for that ſpace without any danger to your perſon, and that ſurer, and with greater ſafetie nor <hi>Iohn Hus</hi> had, who notwithſtanding of his ſafe conduct, yet was brunt.

                     <p>Secondlie, the Scripture not onlie remoues works (as we haue ſaide) from the cauſe of our Iuſtification and ſaluation, but alſo aſcriues it to Faith, as in theſe places, <hi>Whoſoeuer bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth in him ſhall haue eternall life.</hi> And <hi>Thy Faith hath ſaued thee, &amp;c.</hi>

Secondly, ſeing the Faith of miracles &amp; iuſtifying Faith is both one in ſubſtance with your Kirk, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and the Rhemiſts ſayes:
<note place="margin">cap. 5. lib. de iuſti. annotat. in 2.

                     <p>Thirdlie, the Scripture aſcriues our Iuſtification to grace and not to workes: &amp; ſo oppones them, that the one cannot ſtand with the other in the matter of our Iuſtification.

                     <p>As for the 2. of <hi>Iames</hi> whilk ye quote here, that <hi>by works a man is iuſtified and not by ſaith only.</hi> I anſwere. This word <hi>to be iuſtified,</hi> is taken in the Scripture two manner of wayes. Firſt, to be accompted righteous before the tribunal of God: and in this ſenſe, only a liuely faith apprehending the death and righteouſneſſe of Chriſt iuſtifies vs: and of this is the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie. Next, it is taken for a declaration of ones righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, as in the 3. of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> ver. 4. <hi>That thou may be iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified in thy words</hi> (that is, declared to be iuſt) <hi>when thou iudges.</hi> And in this ſenſe it is taken in this place. So that this is the meaning of it. Ye ſee then, <hi>by works man is iuſtified,</hi> that is, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by his works to be iuſt, and <hi>not by faith onlie,</hi> that is, by the profeſsion of his faith in Chriſt. So then <hi>Iames</hi> ſpeakes not of our Iuſtification before God whilk is by faith only, but of the declaration of our righteouſneſſe before men, whilk he calles Iuſtification: and that for theſe reaſons. 1. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>Iames</hi> ſhould be contrary to <hi>Paule</hi> who ſayes, <hi>That a man is iuſtified by faith without workes,</hi> whilk is blaſphemous to think therefore <hi>Iames</hi> ſpeakes of our Iuſtification before men, wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>by our Iuſtification before God is declared and made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt. 2. The ſcope of the whole chapter, and whole Epiſtle te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies the ſame. For his purpoſe is to caſt downe the arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancie and preſumption of ſik, who bragged of their Faith, as though the bare profeſsion, that they beleeued in Chriſt, were ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to ſaue them, ſuppoſe they did not bring forth the fruites thereof. Therefore the Apoſtle takes this in hand to prooue that they are not iuſtified by a dead faith, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie by that faith whilk brings forth the effects thereof. And therefore he ſayes in the fourteenth verſe, <hi>What auayleth it my brethren when a man ſayes he hes faith, when he hes no workes?

                        <hi>Abraham was iuſtified without workes by faith onely: but neuertheleſſe the offering vp of his ſonne, was a teſtification of his faith and righteouſneſse.</hi> What can be more clearlie ſpoken by any?

As to the 2. of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> 13, It is true, <hi>it is not the hearers of the Law, but the doers of it whilk are iuſtified,</hi> if there were any who had fulfilled it. But the Apoſtle concludes in the third chapter, <hi>all vnder ſinne, both Iewe and Gentile:</hi> and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore gathers that <hi>by the workes of the Lawe no fleſh is iuſtified.</hi> And ſo we will leaue this to you to doe, and that alſo in the 19. of <hi>Matthew,</hi> ſpoken to the young man, <hi>Do the commands, &amp;c.</hi> And as for the reſt of the teſtimonies, I wonder to what purpoſe ye haue quoted them, except for to make a ſhewe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and teſtimonies. For they ſpeake onlie of the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of good workes, whilk as they cannot be ſeparate from true faith, ſo no man can attaine to ſaluation without them: becauſe where euer Chriſt dwelles by true Faith, not onelie he iuſtifies them, but alſo ſanctifie them, and makes them fruitfull in good works. The whilk we graunt, and therfore does vrge the ſame continuallie, knowing for a trueth,
<note place="margin">Heb. 12 14 Matth. 3.10</note> that <hi>without holineſſe no man ſhall ſee God, and that the axe is laide to the roote of the tree, and that euery tree that bringeth not forth good fruite ſhalbe hewen downe, and caſt in an vnquencheable fire.</hi> They ſpeake

                     </p>
                     <p>You ſaid a little before, Maiſter <hi>Gilbert,</hi> that the chiefe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference wherein we differ from you is in denying, abhorring or deteſting, &amp;c. Now you ſay, that the difference chiefly of Religion betwixt vs, is about the vnderſtanding of the word of God. How well theſe two aggrees, let the reader iudge. It is no wonder ſuppoſe you diſſent from your brethren (as I haue proued in ſundrie points before) ſeing ye diſſent from your ſelfe. It is true indeede, that many of our controuerſies are about the right ſenſe and vnderſtanding of the ſcripture, but yet if <hi>Petrus a Soto, Lindanus, Pereſius, Caniſius,</hi> all great and learned Papiſts ſpeake trueth, the moſt part of the waighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and chiefeſt points of your religion, whilk are in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:20312:96" rendition="simple:additions"/> betweene vs, are but vnwritten Traditions, whilk hes not their beginning nor authour in the Scripture, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be defended by the ſame. And whereas ye would haue vs to refer the controuerſies about the ſenſe and right mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Scriptures, to be decyded by the writings of the Fathers of the firſt 600. yeares: we receiue their monuments and writings gladlie: but yet ſo, that we put a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, and the writings of the holy Ghoſt in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture. For as I haue prooued ſufficientlie before, as I hope, that onelie the Scriptures of God hes this prerogatiue, to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſupreame iudge of all controuerſies in religion, &amp; no other and the beſt waye to learne the ſenſe of the Scripture, is by the Scripture it ſelf: for ſeing all the Scripture is inſpired of God, therefore it ought to be exponed by God in the ſame. For hee who made the Lawe can beſt interprete the Lawe. And the Leuits practiſed this in the old Teſtament,

So then, nothing can be a warrand to vs of the trueth of the ſenſe of the Scripture, but the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelf. And as for the Fathers expoſitions, as they may not be iudge (as hes bene ſaide) becauſe they may erre, and hes erred, as hes bene proued, &amp; your ſelues will not deny: &amp; they diſſent often-times one from another in the expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſame. So let their expoſitions be taken in ſo far as they aggree with the Scripture. For would ye haue vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriue that vnto them, whilk they themſelues hes refuſed, &amp; hes aſcriued vnto the Scriptures onely?</p>
                     <p>Heare therefore what <hi>Optatus</hi> the Biſhop of the Kirk of <hi>Mileuitan</hi> a learned man who liued about the yeare of God 369. ſayes, writting againſt the Donatiſtes who claimed to themſelues only the title of the Kirk of Chriſt as ye do.

                     <p>Al that you can find fault with here, is this, that I ſaid the Kirk in the time of the Antichriſt, ſhould be latent and lurk &amp; be fed ſecretly: the whilk hes ſtirred you vp in ſik a chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler that you haue cried out with admiration that I haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed the Scripture: &amp;c. Now tel me (Maiſter <hi>Gilbert</hi>) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it becauſe theſe ſame wordes are not founde in the Scripture, or becauſe the doctrine it ſelfe cannot be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by the ſame? If the former, then I ſay you are but a quarreller about words, And all the doctrine whilk ye haue ſet downe in this your anſwer is not ſet downe in ſo manie

If the other: then I ſay beſide other places of Scripture, this ſame place whilk yee quote here confirmes the ſame. For knowe ye not that the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is a place of refuge and ſecrecie from the tyrannie of their purſuers? And they that flies to the ſame, they flie to lurk there, and to be keeped cloſe and ſecret from the rage of their perſecuters for the ſafetie of their liues. So while it is prophecied that <hi>this woman (wherby is ſignified the Kirk,) whilk ſuppoſe ye condtionally expone ſo,</hi>

And if this be an abuſe of the Scripture, then not onelie your ſelfe hes abuſed it, but alſo ſundrie of your owne Kirk, as the Rhemiſtes, <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> &amp; <hi>Sanderus.</hi> For your ſelfe ſayes <hi>that in the time of the Antichriſt, ſhe ſhalbe redacted in a ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as it were in a wilderneſſe, and ſhall not poſſes euerie nation as ſhe had wont to doe.</hi> For what is this els but to lurk and be latent, and to be fed ſecretly, in compariſon of that eſtate wherein ſhe was before?

But what a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictorious ſpirit is this of yours, who to gaineſay the thing that I write, cares not to inuolue your ſelfe in a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not only to the trueth, but alſo to your own Catholicks.

Now as for your reaſon, it is not ſaid that Babylo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was in the deſert, but <hi>that Iohn was taken in the ſpirit,</hi> that is, rauiſhed in the ſpirit (as in the 1. and 4. chapter) <hi>into the deſert</hi> that is, into a ſolitare and heauenlie contemplation of that viſion whilk was afterward ſhowne him. For as this carrying of him in the ſpirit ſignifies his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall rauiſhing, ſo this <hi>deſert</hi> ſignifies the ſolitarenes of his contemplation. And as <hi>that lifting vp of Ezechiell by the lockes of the haire of his head betwene the heauen and the earth, &amp; that carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him to the door of the innermoſt port towards the North, to ſee the abominations of Ieruſalem,</hi> was only in viſion, &amp; not bodily. So I take this carrying of <hi>Iohn</hi> in ſpirit to the wilderneſſe to ſee the whoore of Babylon to haue bene in viſion only, and not bodily. And whereas ye ſay that this worde <hi>deſert</hi> ſignifies more properlie to be hid and inviſible nor the word wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, I pray you tell me (Maiſter <hi>Gilbert</hi>) what is betwene <hi>deſert</hi> &amp; <hi>wilderneſſe?</hi> ſaue that the firſt is driuen from the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, &amp; the ſecond is Engliſh? Muſt you be ſet to the gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſchoole againe? What fancie is this wherewith ye are poſſeſſed, that you put a difference betweene wildernes and deſert?

Appearandly ye haue bene drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in ſome wilderneſſe, or elſe wandring in the wildernes of your owne blind imaginations. As for the expoſition of your trew Catholickes, we count not much of them. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies theſe whome ye call your trew Catholicks, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> the Rhemiſts, and <hi>Sanderus</hi> hes bene plaine in this matter, and hes ſpoken more in this poynt then we doe. And as for the time of this her ſecrecie and lurking 1260. daies whilk you expound literallie to be but three yeares and a halfe. I anſwer, this expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of yours is againſt firſt the cuſtome of propheſies, whilk are expounded figuratiuelie and not lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, as theſe 70. weekes in <hi>Daniel</hi> concerning Chriſt, where there a daye is put for a yeare. Next, it is againſt the whole circumſtances of ihe text: for will you expound this <hi>woman</hi> figuratiuely for the Kirk, as <hi>Sanderus</hi> does: and the <hi>wildernes</hi> vnto the whilk ſhe fled, figuratiuely for the ſmall number wherunto ſhe ſhalbe redacted, as you doe: &amp; the <hi>ſun where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhe was cled, and the moone whilk was vnder her feete, and the twelue ſtarres that was vpon her head, and the red Dragon whilk per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſewed her with ten heads &amp;c.</hi> all figuratiuelie, and yet will yee expound the time of her being in the wilderneſſe literallie? What violence is this whilk yee will offer vnto the holye trueth of God, to expound all the reſt figuratiuely, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the time literallie? So then a day here is ſet for a yeare, as alſo it is taken in the ſame ſenſe in the 2. chapter of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation</hi> in the Epiſtle to Smyrna, where it is ſaid <hi>they ſhal haue tribulation for the ſpace of ten dayes:</hi> that is, for the ſpace of ten yeares. As for the inviſibility of our Kirk, becauſe that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion cums afterward, therefore I omit it now. Only this, as your Hierarchie and abhomination of your Kirk grew, ſo did the puritie of the doctrine of Ieſus Chriſt in his Kirk de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay. And as your Popes came not to their height at an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and brought not in their abhominations at an inſtant

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:20312:106"/> as ye do: for becauſe the reuelations alreadie made by God to his Kirk, and written in his holy Scripture doth not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand your abhominable and falſe doctrine, and your Popes ſupremacy, whilk is the foundation of all: therefore you and your Kirk flees to vn-written Traditions, &amp; fained reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to proue the ſame. As for example, becauſe your Kirk hes not ſo much as a ſillabe in the whole booke of God, to proue that <hi>Peters</hi> ſeat was tranſlated from <hi>Antiochia</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> whilk is the whole fundation of all Poperie,
<note place="margin">Cauſa 24. queſt. 1. cap.

You ſay firſt, becaus I note no place: &amp; next, becaus theſe words of mine, are no wayes in Saint <hi>Iohn.</hi> Therefore ye conclude it to be an invention of my owne. As to the firſt.

Heir is twa things to be noted: Firſt, that the Kirk ſhall not be inviſible in the time of Antichriſt: for if the Paſtors of the Kirk be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible, how ſhall they be taken, and put to death? If the Antichriſt and his members ſhall ſlay them, how can they doe the ſame, except they know and may ſee them? To be inviſible, is not to be knowne or ſeene: but they will ſee and know them, or elſe they cannot diſcerne them from their owne, wherby they may put them to death, and ſaue their owne. The ſecond thing to be noted, that our Miniſters in Scotland except they be put to death by the Pope, they beare not the teſtimonie of Chriſt. For theſe are Maiſter Iohns owne words. And S. Iohn ſayes,
<note place="margin">Apoc. 11.7.8</note> That the beaſt ſhall ſlay the two Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.

As for the time and place, and their reuiuing and aſcending vp to heauen, it is to be vnderſtood after the manner of prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, myſticallie and figuratiuelie, as I haue prooued before. The time of three dayes and an halfe, ſignifying all the time of your tyrannous crueltie. The place of their ignominy is the ſtreetes of that great Cietie,

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:20312:109" rendition="simple:additions"/> and vncleanneſſe: Aegypt and Babylon for her tyranny and crueltie euer the Saints of God, wherein ſhe reſembls them. So is ſhe not literallie the place where Chriſt was crucified, but only myſticallie and ſpirituallie for the likenes betwene them: that as by the authoritie of the Emperour of Rome, his deputie Pilate our Lord was crucified, for the falſe chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge of treaſon againſt the Emperour, whilk was falſly and wickedlie laide to his charge: and therefore is ſaide heir by the holy ghoſt, to be crucified at Rome: that is, by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the rulers at Rome: So by the authority of the Popes who now reignes &amp; hes reigned theſe many yeares at Rome, Chriſt is crucified againe in his members, becauſe they will not receaue his marke, and worſhip him. And as Ieruſalem boaſted her ſelf to be a holie cietie, and the ſpouſe of Chriſt, and yet was a harlote, a murtherer,
<note place="margin">Exod. 20.</note> and a perſecuter of the Saints: ſo Rome doth boaſt her ſelf to be a holy ciety, and the ſpouſe of Chriſt, and the head of all: and yet is nowe, and is long ſince become an harlot and a murtherer, &amp; a peſecuter of the Saints. And if ye will aske, When did the bodies of the Saints lye in the ſtreetes of Rome? I anſwere: As by the <hi>gates in the cietie</hi> in the fourt command, is not meant the gates of the cietie properlie, but the authoritie and iuriſdiction of the cietie: ſo by the ſtreetes of Rome is not onely meant the gates within the walles of Rome, but all the places and parts whither his power and dominion hes ſpred the ſelfe. So that all the places where the Popes of Rome hes exerciſed their tyrannie ouer the Saints, are called heir the ſtreetes of that great Cietie. All theſe therefore who hes bene cruelly mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by the Popes authority in England, Scotland, France the low countries, &amp;c and whole bodies hes bene caſt out, &amp; whoſe bodies hes beene ignominiouſly handled, they haue lyen in the ſtreetes of that great cietie And as all the reſt of this prophecie is to be vnderſtood ſpiritually, ſo is this, <hi>reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and aſcending of theſe Witneſſes to heauen in the ſight of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,</hi> to be vnderſtood not literallie, but ſpirituallie. So this is not the meaning of the holy Ghoſt that theſe Witneſſes whome the Antichriſt ſhall ſlaye ſhalbe raiſed vp againe in
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:20312:110" rendition="simple:additions"/> their owne perſons (whilk yet ſhall be at the laſt day in the generall reſurrection:) but that the Lord ſhall raiſe vp other Witneſſes, indued with that ſame ſpirit, whilk they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with: preaching the ſame trueth, and maintaining the ſame cauſe againſt Antichriſt, as that prophecie in the 3. of <hi>Malachie</hi> of the <hi>ſending of Elias before the comming of Chriſt,</hi> was fulfilled,

If the true Kirk opponed the ſelfe to the Antichriſtian Kirk, then it was viſible and knowne, and if it was knowne when the Popes kingdome was at the higheſt, much more when it was lowe. &amp; ſo it was alwaies known by Maiſter Iohns ſelfe.</p>

If the firſt, then you are fooliſh who fights againſt your ſelf, as ye doe indeede: if the ſecond, then I ſay, that whilk I ſaide was this: that no man ſhould thinke that the Kirk of God was euer open and viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in that flouriſhing eſtate as it is nowe. For this is our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, Maiſter <hi>Gilbert,</hi> concerning the inviſibility of the kirk the whilk becauſe you know not, therefore you ſtumble at it and oppugnes only your owne inuention, and not our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: and therefore your reaſons and Scriptures whilk ye bring heir, ſerues to no purpoſe, for they make nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs. We ſay that the Catholick Kirk whilk compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends al the elect is alwaies inuiſible,

Next vve ſay that the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular viſible Kirks are not alvvaies in one outward eſtate: ſometimes outvvardly glorious, ſometimes more obſcure: ſometimes openlye knovvne and ſeene by all: ſometimes knovvne and ſeene but by a fevv: ſometimes frequent, and conſiſting in manie, ſometimes rare and conſiſting in fevve: ſometimes adorned vvith outvvarde ornaments of peace, largeneſſe, outvvard glorie &amp; multitude: ſometimes againe wanting this outvvard glory vnderperſecution. But yet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that invvard glorie of theſe invvard graces. So that when we ſay theſe particular Kirks are ſometimes inuiſible, we doe not meane as though they were knowne to none (for that is not our doctrine, Maiſter <hi>Gilbert,</hi> as ye imagine:) but that they are not ſo openlie knowne that they are patent to all to be the true Kirk: but knowne vnto them with whome they haue to do, and who profeſſes the trueth with them.

For both theſe, Maiſter <hi>Gilbert,</hi> are true, and neither of them repugning one another: that the particular Kirks in the time of the Antichriſt, are not ſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penlie knowne, and ſo outwardlie glorious and flouriſhing, as they were before: but redacted to a ſmall number, more obſcure and more latent: partly through that vniuerſall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and partly through that extreame perſecution of your Kirk and head: and that there was ſome that opponed themſelues to the Pope and his Cleargie, and that euen whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was come to the height.

                        <label>Maiſter Iohn Welſche his Reply.</label>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let vs ſee the force of this argument that ye make for your Pope, that he is not the Antichriſt. The woman, ye ſay, that fled to the wilderneſſe, is the true Kirk: that I graunt: &amp; to fly into the wilderneſſe is to be inuiſible by me. I anſwere: By me it is to be latent, and to lurke, to eſchew the rage of her perſecuters, and not to be openlie conuerſant, as that all the worlde may knowe her: and yet not to be ſo latent, but that ſome of them are knowne both amongſt themſelues, as alſo to their enemies. And this is our meaning (as I haue ſaid before) vvhen vve affirme that the particular Kirks ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times becomes inviſible. But you take it as though our mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning were that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kirk is ſo inuiſible, that it is known to none whilk is your inuention, Maiſter <hi>Gilbert,</hi> and not our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: and therefore you fight without an aduerſarie in this point. But to goe forward to the reſt of your argument: you ſay, that by me there was ſundrie that oppugned the Pope, and his Cleargie, and was put to death by them, This is true: and therefore <hi>the blood of the Saints is found</hi> in your Kirk. Now what will you gather of all this? Therefore ſay you the Pope is not the Antichriſt, becauſe he perſecuts but viſible things, or elſe, the Kirk is not inuiſible. I deny that either the one or the other will follow. And becauſe you made an argument againſt your Pope (I ſhould haue ſaid with him) that he is not the Antichriſt, whilk is grounded vpon your owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention, miſtaking our doctrine, and therefore hes no feete: I will make another for him that he is the Antichriſt, the whilk you nor all your Cleargie will not be able to diſproue. He is that vndoubted Antichriſt, whilk hes redacted the kirk of Chriſt, as it were in a wilderneſſe, to a ſmal handfull: part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through the peſt of his damnable doctrine, partly throgh his extreame perſecution, ſo that they were compelled to lurke and hyde themſelues from the crueltie of his power. This you cannot deny, becauſe the Scripture affirmes this of the Antichriſt. But I aſſume, that the Popes of Rome hes done this theſe many hundreth yeares, as I haue proued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and in the other part of my anſwere: therfore of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:20312:114"/> it muſt followe, that the Popes of Rome are the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt that the Scripture foretold ſhould come. Anſwere this if you can.</p>
                     <p>And as for the time of this inuiſibilitie, it hes relation to the beginning, and grouth, and hight of your Antichriſtian kingdome: for as it grewe the Kirk was more and more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured: and when it was at the hight, the Kirk was in her E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe: and as it hes decaied now ſince, ſhe hes accordinglie ſpred her ſelf abroade.

The Kirk of Chriſt may neuer want the true preaching of the word and right adminiſtration of the Sacraments: but theſe things are alwaies viſible, becauſe by the Miniſters they are the ſignes and markes of the Kirk: therefore the true Kirk may be alwayes knowne by them.

So leaue off (Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Gilbert</hi>) to beguile the ſimple and ignorant people with this ſottiſh and blaſphemous reaſon of yours, (<hi>Martine Luther</hi> is the author of our religion) for nowe you are inforced to graunt the contrarie that infinite nombers hes taught the ſame doctrine before him. The truth is too ſtrong for you (Maiſter <hi>Gilbert</hi>) that compels you to graunt the thing that ye woulde wiſh with all your hart the people neuer knew it: but comfort your ſelfe (Maiſter <hi>Gilbert</hi>) for the trueth will be victorious at the laſt, and your darknes daily more and more will be diſcouered. Indeede the leaſt ſtroke that ye can giue for the defence of your Pope is to call them all heretickes who hes ſpoken againſt him, for I graunt the Pope and his Clergie is not ſik fooles, as being their owne Iudges to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:20312:118"/> them ſelues, and to iuſtifie them, who not onely hes taught it, but alſo ſufficiently did prooue it, and many thouſands ſealed with their blood that he was the Antichriſt, &amp; his Kirk <hi>Babell.</hi> But with them, they haue the <hi>ſonne of God, &amp; the Apoſtles, Paule and Iohn</hi> heretickes: for they alſo did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne his Idolatry, and tyrannie, and errors. But where a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout now will ye contend (Maiſter <hi>Gilbert?</hi>) ye ſay whether their doctrine be hereſie or not? I would you and your Kirk would ſtand vpon this, and giue ouer all your other conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions whill this were firſt prooued, whether their doctrine in ſo far as they aggree with ours: &amp; ours, in ſo far as it diſſents from yours, be hereſie or not, that is, be againſt the ſcripture or not, the whilk if you would doe, then I hope our conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would ſoone be ended. But for as faſt as you runne to this now, you will flee from it as faſt againe, when we deſire to haue yours &amp; our doctrine, tried by the Scriptures whilk of them is hereſie: and conſequently, whether ye or we be heretickes? And therefore you euer refuſe to let your doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine be tried by the ſcripture, but runnes to your prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded antiquitie, and ſucceſſions, Councels, and lying miracles, &amp; many other vaine ſtarting holes, like a vvilde Fox, when he is hunted out of one hole he flies to another, and dare neuer abyde the faire fields. And marke their craft, reader, vvhen vve affirme that our religion hes Ieſus Chriſt to bee the author of it in the Scriptures, as vve offer to proue the ſame, yee refuſe this triall by the Scriptures, and ſayes that <hi>Martine Luther</hi> inuented our religion, and vve had none that profeſſed it, and taught it before him.

And certainlie, Maiſter <hi>Gilbert,</hi> if this reaſon of yours holde forth, you ſhall cut off from your profeſsion ſik a nomber of Popes, Councels, Ieſuites, Cardinals, &amp; Doctors fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that it is to be feared, that they cut you off from being a right defender of their Catholick faith, yea from beeing a member of their ſynagogue, that for the defence thereof is compelled to cut off ſo many from the ſame. And ſecondly, I ſay, your reports concerning their doctrine, is not to be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited, but their owne apologies and writings, whereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares that it hes bene alwaies your faſhion, the more to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credite them, to charge them with a number of abſurde opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, whilk they neuer held. As for example, you charge heir <hi>Waldus</hi> and his followers to haue had their wiues, and al other things common, whilk is your calumnie of them, and not their practiſe, or doctrine. For <hi>Gulielmus Parvus</hi> wrytes <hi>that their life was commendable,</hi> &amp; <hi>Reinerus</hi> in his booke of inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, one of your owne religion, a writer of 300. yeares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe, who was often at the examination of them, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſaies, confeſſes <hi>that they had great ſhew of holy lyfe, and that they beleeued all things well of God, and all the articles contained in the Creed, and liued iuſtly before men: and charges them that they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and blaſphemed</hi> ſolam Romanam Eccleſiam, <hi>the Romiſh Kirk only.</hi> So then, if his report be true, as I hope ye will not gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay, they were both far from that error, for that were neither to beleeue all things well of God, nor yet to haue a ſhewe of holy life, and to liue iuſtly before men: and alſo they were of our religion in all things.</p>
                     <p>And where you ſay that we renew many old condemned hereſies: I anſwer, that neither the doctrine whilk I affirmed they taught heir was hereſies, nor yet themſelues hereticks. But you and your Kirk who hes condemned them for the trueth of God, and hes renewd olde condemned hereſies, as ſhall be proued afterward. And we haue renewd no hereſie at all, but onely the trueth of God whilk your Kirk hes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:20312:120"/> and buried. Therefore your concluſion is falſe, that our religion was neuer profeſſed in all points as it is now in Scotland before in no countrie, no not, ſay you, by anie one man. For it was taught &amp; profeſſed by Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and alſo by all the primitiue Kirks in their daies, in all points, throughout all the partes of the world, where they preached the Goſpel, as it is now in Scotland, as we offer to proue by their writtings, and I haue proued the ſame in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie heads heir. Next, the ſubſtance thereof was continued manie hundreth yeares in the Kirks of Chriſt, whill partlie by the hereſies that ſprang vp (for the popple was ſoone ſowne among the good ſeede, and the myſterie of iniquitie began to work in the Apoſtles daies) and partly by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet, &amp; partly by the darknes of Poperie, it was corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted peece &amp; peece. And what difference can you finde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the religion that the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> profeſſed, and vs; if ye will giue credite to their Apologies, and <hi>Reinerus</hi> teſtimonies of them? As for Maiſter <hi>Robert Bruſes</hi> teſtimonye whilk yee produce, it ſerues no waies to confirme your purpoſe: but ſeeing ye abuſe the teſtimonies of Scripture, it is no wonder ſuppoſe yee abuſe the teſtimonies of men. For it is moſt true whilk he affirmes that the trueth of God hes continued for that ſpace in this kingdome without hereſie or ſchiſme, as we neuer read it did in any nation in the earth, in ſik purity without hereſie and ſchiſme for ſik a long ſpace. And yet it followes not but he hes dwelt in ſundrie Kirks in ſik puritie before, ſuppoſe not ſo long together, whilk you omit in your concluſion. Doth it follow by his teſtimony, but that our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion hes bene preached &amp; profeſſed in all true Kirks, in all points, ſuppoſe not ſo long in ſik purity, as it is in Scotland? neither doth it followe but that the ſubſtantiall and maine points of our religion hes beene profeſſed in all Chriſtian Kirks, longer nor that ſpace, ſuppoſe mixed either with ſom hereſies or ſchiſmes. So you muſt coine a new logick (Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Gilbert</hi>) before ye can confirme your propoſition by his teſtimonie.</p>

                     <p>You note two things heere whilk are both falſe: the one that I can finde none that ſaid againſt the Pope and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion before the yeare of Chriſt 1158. for our Sauiour and his Apoſtles and ſundrie learned Fathers in all ages, and councels, both general and prouincial: and ſum of your own doctors and Popes, hes ſpoken againſt the Monarchie of your Pope, and your doctrine &amp; religion, as I haue proued before. And <hi>Reinerus</hi> a man of your ovvne religion teſtifies that ſome ſaide <hi>the Waldenſes who had the ſame religion whilk we proſes, was continued from Silueſters daies, who liued about the</hi> 320. <hi>yeare of God. And ſome ſaid that it continued euen from the Apoſtles daies:</hi> therefore the firſt is falſe. The ſecond thing is, that I can finde none before <hi>Luther</hi> immediatlye the ſpace of 100. yeares and more. I ſee you are not aſhamed to ſpeake anie thing for the defence of your Kingdome, vvere it neuer ſo manifeſtlie falſe: for it appeares that eyther yee are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted vvith the hiſtories of that age, or elſe yee diſſemble it of purpoſe: for <hi>Iohn Wickleſ</hi> he left ſo manye behinde him in England vvho profeſſed our religion, that though your Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates did moleſt them vvhat they coulde, yet they &amp; their fauourers in ſhort tyme grew to ſik ſtrength &amp; multitude, that by the yeare 1422. (whilk was 100. yeares immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately before <hi>Luther) Henrie Chicheſley</hi> the Arch-biſhop of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terburie writ to the Pope, that they all could not be ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed they were ſo manie, but by force of warre. The profeſſors of our religion began to gather ſo great force in <hi>Bohemia</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the burning of <hi>Iohn Hus,</hi> and <hi>Ierome</hi> of <hi>Prage</hi> at the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> whilk was about the yeare 1417. (whilk was iuſt ane hundreth yeare immediatly before <hi>Luther</hi>) that they
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:20312:121"/> were able not only to defend themſelues by force of armes againſt the tyrannie of your Popes, but alſo obtained many notable victories, againſt the ſtrongeſt power that the Pope did raiſe againſt them. In England <hi>William Tayler,</hi> was bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>anno</hi> 1422, and two yeares after that <hi>William White</hi> was burnt. And betwixt that time, and 1430. Father <hi>Abraham</hi> of <hi>Colcheſter, Iohn Wadden,</hi> and <hi>Richard Houington</hi> were burnt. And after that, <hi>Richard Wiche,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Gooſe,</hi> one <hi>Braban,</hi> and one <hi>Ierome,</hi> and others with him were burnt. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronymus Sauonarola,</hi> a Monke in Italie, with two others, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Dominick</hi> and <hi>Sylveſter,</hi> were condemned to death at <hi>Florence,</hi> in the yeare 1500, with ſundry others whome for ſhortneſſe I omit heir. Nowe ſurelie, I cannot but wonder, Maiſter <hi>Gilbert,</hi> that ye ſhould haue bene ſo impudent as to haue ſet it downe in write, that I could get none that profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed our Religion, an hundreth yeare immediatly before <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tine Luther.</hi> But the reader may gather what credite he may giue to your notes: and yet vvith ſik impudent lies ye blind the poore people. Vpon the vvhilk I gather, that both theſe concluſions of yours, is falſe. For the Kirk of Chriſt in all ages, euen from the Apoſtles dayes to this day, hes euer had her owne teachers and profeſſors, (vnto whome <hi>Martine Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> hes ſucceeded in his religion) ſuppoſe not in the like fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quencie and puritie,
<note place="margin">Apoc 9.</note> and that by reaſon partly of <hi>the ſmoak of that bottomleſſe pit,</hi> that is of your doctrine,
<note place="margin">Reu. 15.</note> 
                        <hi>whilk darkened both the Sunne and the aire,</hi> that is, both teachers and people: and partly by your extreame perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whereby ye <hi>made warre with the Saints of God and ouercame them.</hi> But your ſmoak will euaniſhe away at the laſt, and the cleare light of the Lorde ſhall ſhine more and more, maugre all your hearts.</p>

                        <hi>but his portion ſhall be in that lake that burnes with fire and brimſtone, and he that ſlandereth his neighbour (much more then be who ſlandereth the trueth of God) ſhall not reſt in the Lords holy mountaine.</hi> But to come to the firſt, <hi>Nouatus</hi> intruded himſelfe in another mans charge, and cauſed ſet vp himſelfe againſt <hi>Cornelius</hi> the lawfull Paſtor in the Kirk in Rome then, &amp; that craftilie: and withdrew many of his flock from him, whilk is as contrarie to our doctrine, as black to white. For we teach that euery paſtor ſhould haue his owne particular flock, as <hi>Cornelius</hi> had then in Rome, and no man ſhould intrude him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in another mans charge, as he did. So this is a calumny, Maiſter <hi>Gilbert.</hi> But your Popes are like <hi>Nouatus,</hi> who not only hes diſturbed al the Chriſtian congregations in Europe almoſte, by ſetting vp and thruſting downe ſik Paſtors as he would, but alſo all the kingdomes in Europe. As for this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Aerius,</hi> I anſwere you, as ye did me: I contend not whether he taught this doctrine or not, for the ſcriptures hes taught the ſame. But our contention is, whether they be he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie or not, whilk you haue not prooued, nor euer will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to proue by the Scripture. It is true <hi>Epiphamus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> following him, reckons him amongſt heretickes, but <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoretus</hi> in his booke <hi>de fabulis Iudaerum,</hi> and the Eccleſiaſtical hiſtorie reckons him not amongſt hereticks: and he was not condemned for an heretick in any Councell: that therefore whilk he taught according to the Scripture we imbrace. But as for the errors of the <hi>Acrians,</hi> whilk are errors in deede, and whilk are aſcriued vnto them, <hi>as the damning of marriage, vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of continencie, requyring them whome they receaue to their fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to forſake their owne proper things:</hi> theſe hereſies, I ſay, your Kirk hes renewed, who damnes marriage, and vrges conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:20312:122"/> in your Cleargie, and receaues none to your religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous orders, but ſik as refuſes their owne proper things. As to the third, the <hi>Aetian</hi> and <hi>Eunomian</hi> hereſies, they ſecluded ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of life from that faith of theirs, and taught ſik a faith that might ſtand with whatſoeuer ſinnes, and with perſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in them. Will you ſtand to this (Maiſter <hi>Gilbert</hi>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, that we teach ſik doctrine? Is not this our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that only liuing faith whilk works by loue, &amp; brings forth good fruits doth iuſtifie? But you are like to them that knowes no other iuſtifying faith, but ſik a faith, as both the reprobates and the Diuels may haue. So this is your third calumnie.</p>

                     <p>Whether <hi>Valentinus</hi> taught ſo or not, I contend not: but the queſtion is of this doctrine, of the reall preſence, whether it be contrare to Gods word, or not; the whilk I haue proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſufficiently before in the fourth point of doctrine: and ſo the denying of it is no hereſie. But yet it appeares not by this teſtimonie of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> whilk ye cite heir, that he taught ſik doctrine.</p>
                     <p>As for the 8. hereſie, it is a calumnie to aſcriue it to vs, for <hi>Melanchton, Caluine,</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> hes no ſik doctrine. You are not aſhamed, Maiſter <hi>Gilbert,</hi> of impudent lying.</p>
                     <p>As for the 9. of <hi>Nouatus</hi> hereſie, that is a calumnie to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriue it to vs. I or <hi>Nouatus</hi> denied that there was any place of repentance to theſe, who after they were baptiſed, fel from the faith, by ony infirmitie, or violence of perſecution, as <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piphanius</hi> teſtifies of him that hee ſaide, <hi>No man who hes falne after Baptiſme can any more obtaine mercie.</hi> But our doctrine is
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:20312:124"/> contrare to this: for we teach that there is place to repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce for any ſinne, except the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt, whilk is euer puniſhed with finall impenitencie.</p>
                     <p>As for the 10. of the <hi>Manichees</hi> hereſie, their doctrine was as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayes there, that <hi>Baptiſme ſerued nothing for ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to anye: and that none, who followed their ſect, ſhould be baptized.</hi> and therefore they broght in a contempt of Baptiſme, whilk is contrarie our doctrine. For we teache that Chriſtians and their children is to be baptized: and that the contempt of it is damnable, ſuppoſe not the want of it.</p>
                     <p>As for the 11. and 12. hereſies, we contemne not faſtings that are appointed by the Kirk, for lawful cauſes: but we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that they ſhould be tied to certaine and prefixed dayes, as your Kirk does: and we thinke it no hereſie to faſt on the Lords day, more then other dayes: both to ſtirre vp our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and to make vs more meet to holy and ſpirituall exerciſes, becauſe it is not contrary to the word of God. As for <hi>Leo</hi> his Epiſtle, it is wrong quoted, for it ſhould be Epiſt. 91. and there faſting on the Lords day is not like ours: for they faſted on the Lordes day, becauſe they beleeued not that Chriſt was a true man, as <hi>Leo</hi> in that ſame place teſtifies whilk you will not ſay your ſelfe that we do, for we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him to be a true man.</p>
                     <p>As for the 13. hereſie of the <hi>Pepuſians</hi> and <hi>Collyridians,</hi> their doctrine was that wemen might be Biſhops, and Elders, &amp; might vſe theſe publick functions, as theſe places whilk ye haue quoted, teſtifies: whilk is not our doctrine, but rather yours, who permits wemen to baptize, in caſe of neceſsity. That they denied orders to be a Sacrament, there is no ſik thing to be found in theſe places whilk ye quote heir.</p>
                     <p>As for the 14. hereſie of the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> if they denied that theſe who were accuſed of any ſcandalous offence, &amp; guilty thereof; ſhould make their confeſsion of it to God, his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, &amp; the Congregation, for to take away the offence of it, then they erred, and our doctrine and practiſe condemnes this: but if they denied the abſolute neceſsity of your auri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular confeſsions, then is it no errour, becauſe there is na ſik
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:20312:124"/> thing commanded in the whole Scriptures of God. Nowe as for the teſtimonie of <hi>Boetius,</hi> I haue not ſeene it. As for their ſecond hereſie concerning Baptiſme, they taught, as <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> reportes in that place, <hi>that Baptiſme was not needfull to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, becauſe they were borne without original ſinne,</hi> as they taught whilk is an hereſie indeede: but this is a calumnie to aſcriue it to vs, for we teach that children are borne in originall ſin, and ſo ſhoulde be baptized. And ſurelie this hereſie rather aggrees to you, who teaches that <hi>Marie</hi> was not borne in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall ſinne, and therefore ſhe needed not to be baptized.</p>
                     <p>As for the laſt of the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> denying the order of Monks. I anſwere: firſt, your Papiſticall and Idolatrous Monkes,
<note place="margin">Bellari 2. de indulgentus</note> are farre different from theſe whilk <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, and theſe of the Primitiue Kirk. For firſt they were bound to no preſcript forme of diet, apparell, or any thing elſe, by ſolemne vowes of wilfull pouertie, and perpetual co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinencie, as yours are, next, the former Monks remained in the order of priuate men, and laicks, and had no thing to do with Eccleſiaſticall charges, whilk was afterward broken by Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the 4. <hi>anno</hi> 606. But yours are not ſo: they haue Eccleſiaſticall charges, and are more then priuate men. And laſt of all, ſuppoſe their kinde of life was mixed with ſome ſuperſtition, for the <hi>enuious man ſone ſowed the popple amongſt the good ſeede, and the myſtery of iniquity began ſone to worke:</hi> yet their religion was not defiled with Idolatrie, worſhipping of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, praiers to Saints, opinion of merite, the ſacrifice of the Maſſe, and other abhominations wherewith your Papiſticall Monkes are defiled. Next I ſay, theſe Monkes and religious orders of yours, hes not their foundation within the foure corners of the Scripture of God.</p>

                     <p>Now heere was all the cauſe (Chriſtian reader) that made (Maiſter <hi>Gilbert</hi>) ſo oft to cry out of vs, that wee renued old condemned hereſies, whereof ſome are ſik as wee our ſelues condemne, and ſome are ſik whilk doe better aggree vnto themſelues, nor vnto vs: &amp; ſome hereſies he forceth vpon vs whilk wee neuer taught nor maintayned: and ſome are ſik whilk are not hereſies indeede, but aggreable to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of God. So that if we erre in theſe, ſuffer vs to erre with Ieſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles. Now to anſwer to your argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whilk ye bring. What euer was hereſie in olde times, is hereſie yet, and the defenders thereof heretickes. I anſwer, if ye define hereſie to be an error obſtinately maintained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Scriptures of God: I graunt your propoſition. But if ye define hereſies in generall, to be whatſomeuer any one Father or Doctor, or ſome more hes rebuked as an hereſie; then I deny it, for ſundrie of the fathers hes maintained er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors themſelues againſt the Scripture, and hes accuſed ſome doctrine to bee hereſies, whilk hes bene aggreeable to the trueth of God, whilk you will not deny, I hope. For if you would, I could proue it both of the Fathers, Councels, and your owne Popes. Now to your aſſumption. But theſe former heads, ſay ye, whilk ye haue ſet downe with manye the like was hereſies in olde tymes, and the defenders thereof here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, as teſtifieth the auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Fathers.

And therefore, your concluſion fals not vpon vs, who hes renewed no olde condemned he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, and therefore is not heretickes. And where you ſaye many other like.

                     </p>
                     <p>It is not impoſsible to proue your Popes to be the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt. It hes beene prooued alreadie by the learned on our ſide: to the whilk you, and all your Cleargie of Rome is not able to anſwere. It hes bene taught &amp; ſealed with the blood of infinite nombers of Chriſtians: and I haue not taken ſo long a tearme as you haue ſet downe heir, and yet, I hope, I haue proued it ſufficiently. Put all your might to diſproue it if you can. And as to that threatning of yours, Maiſter <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> wherein ye ſay that all theſe, who will not openly and priuatelie obey the Pope, &amp;c, muſt drinke of the wine of the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:20312:128"/> wrath of God. If it may be beleeued, then howe doth this ſtand firſt with your Popes pardons, whereby he giues men pardon or licence to profeſſe, ſubſcriue, and ſweare to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: as it is reported that ſome of your owne religion hes confeſſed it? Next, howe ſtands it with the diſsimulation of your Ieſuites, and ſeminarie Prieſts when they come to any place where our religion is openlie profeſſed? Thirdly, what comfort is this whilk ye haue pronounced to your own poor countriemen, who doe not openly avow Papiſtrie, but hes ſubſcriued and communicate with vs? Is this an open profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or not? And if it be not, if ye be a true Prophet, then muſt they drinke of the wine of the wrath of God, then muſt they be condemned in Hel by your iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, becauſe they profeſſe him not openlie. And laſt of all, if this threatning of yours be true, then beſide the many infinite thouſands who profeſſes him to be the Antichriſt, you condemne to Hell all the Greeke and Eaſtern Kirks, who in nomber far exceedes them who obeyes you, and all the Kirks that hes bene 600. yeere and more after Chriſt: for they obeyed not the Pope openlie nor priuatlie as Chriſts Vicare ouer them, as I haue prooued before. And alſo you condemne a nomber of your Anti-Popes to Hell, with their Cardinals, Biſhops, &amp; Kirks who followed them: for they gaue out themſelues to bee Popes, and did not obey the other. As alſo a nomber of the Fathers of your owne religion, who in two general councels the one of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> where there was almoſt 1000. Fathers: the other of <hi>Baſile,</hi> did not obey the pope, in defining general councels to be aboue the Pope. So, if ye ſpeak trueth, infinite millions of Chriſtians in all ages, and innumerable Kirks, &amp; thouſands of your owne religion are condemned to hell. But this is falſe, Maiſter <hi>Gilbert,</hi> and who will beleeue you? And to the end nowe my concluſion yet holdes ſure, that ſeeing his kingdome is that <hi>ſecond beaſt that hes two hornes like the Lamb and ſpeakes like the Dragon:</hi> and himſelf is that <hi>man of ſinne,</hi>

And the ſmoake of his torment ſhall aſcend for euer more: and they ſhall haue no reſt daye nor night whilk worſhip the beaſt or his image. And as for your praier, I beſeech God (Maiſter <hi>Gilbert</hi>) that he may open my eies, and inlarge my harte to vnderſtande and imbrace his trueth more and more, and to make me to growe vp in that ſpirituall communion with Chriſt and his members more and more.

Wherin it is ſhewed: firſt, that Antichriſt ſhould not be a Iewe, and repaire to the temple of Ieruſalem, and the Iewes ſhoulde not receaue the Antichriſt, as their Meſſias: next, that the Pope. ſuppoſe he pretends that he come in the name of Chriſt, &amp; that he is the Vicare of Chriſt, and the ſeruand of ſeruands: yet he is nothing leſſe. He hes neyther his calling of God in his worde, nor is left in the roome of Chriſt: but hes entered in, not by the doore into the ſheepefolde, but another way, as a thief and briggane, to ſteale and deuoure, and does no true ſeruice to Chriſt, but tyrannizes ouer his pure flock, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the princes of the earth. Thirdly, that the Antichriſt ſhould not bee one ſingular perſon, but a ſucceſſion of manie, in the ſelf ſame, Apoſtate kingdome and tyrannie. Fourthly, that for all his pretenſes of humility and piety, yet he is an aduerſary to God, and lifted vp aboue all that is called God.</p>
                     <p>Secondlye, it is proued by all the markes whereby the Antichriſt is diſcriued in the Scriptures of God. in the <hi>2. Theſ. 2.

<pb n="211" facs="tcp:20312:131"/> forth as examples to proue this. Secondly, it is proued that he is an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſary to God, by comparing of his doctrine with the doctrine of Chriſt how it ouerthrowes his perſon, offices, Propheticall, Prieſtly and Kingly, and all his benefites, and all the meanes, outwarde and inwarde, of the knowing and applying of them: and that it depriues the Lord of his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne glorie, in communicating to ſtockes and ſtones, oyle and water a peece of bread, Angell and man, bones and aſhes, and the moſte vyle things that can be. And alſo howe it ouerthrowes the Sacramentes of Chriſt, and puts to others whilk he neuer inſtituted: &amp; the whole frame of his Diſcipline and gouernment, whilk he hes commanded in his word His officers, his offices, his Lawes. And hes put himſelf in Chriſts roome and hes made newe offices, officers, &amp; lawes, whilk the Scripture knows not of.

                     <p>This for the name: nowe to the matter. This is one of the greateſt controuerſies betwixt you and vs, concerning your ſacrifice of the Maſſe: whilk, as ye account it moſt heauenly, ſo we account it moſt abhominable, as that whilk iniures the ſonne of God, whilk derogates from his death and paſsion, whilk is iniurious to his euerlaſting Prieſt-hoode, whilk is i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous, vaine, neidleſſe, and fruteleſſe, whilk hinders and ouerthrowes the true ſeruice of God: all whilk ſhalbe made plaine of it, by Gods grace. The matter of our controuerſie therefore is: Whether Ieſus Chriſt, God and man, his bodie and blood be perſonally and corporally offered vp, in your ſacrifice of the Maſſe, (as ye call it) and whether this your ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice be a propitiatorie ſacrifice, for the ſinnes of the quicke and the deade: this your Kirk affirmes and holdes, and this we deny. Now let vs ſee your reaſons firſt, and then we will ſet downe what reaſons we haue for vs out of the worde of God, to the contrary. As to yours. Firſt, ye ſay it was prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured by the Law of <hi>Moſes:</hi> next, forſpoken by the Prophets and thirdly, done and inſtituted by Chriſt our Sauiour, and commanded by him to be done to the end of the world. As to the firſte, This ſacrifice was prefigured by the ſacrifices of the olde Teſtament, for the whilk purpoſe ye quote <hi>Leuit.</hi> 2. and 6.20. Vnto the whilk I anſwere: that the ſacrifices of the olde Teſtament were figures and ſhadowes, of that great &amp; bloody ſacrifice of Chriſt Ieſus, <hi>once offered vp,</hi> vpon the croce, neuer to be offered vp againe, as
<note n="e)" place="margin">Heb. 9.25.26.27.28.</note> the Apoſtle ſaies: and of our ſpirituall ſacrifices, and ſeruice to God, whereof the
<note n="f)" place="margin">Rom. 12.1. Heb. 13.15.16.</note> Apoſtle ſpeakes in theſe places cited on the margent. The whilk alſo were fulfilled in that one, and only ſacrifice of him ſelfe vpon the croce, for the ſinnes of the world: and are ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in our <hi>ſpirituall ſacrifices of our ſelues,</hi> &amp; of the <hi>calues of our lips</hi> continuallie. But that theſe were figures of your abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable ſacrifice in the Maſſe, there is not a ſillabe in the whole Scripture, to proue the ſame: for that whilk was prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured in the olde Teſtament, was, and is fulfilled in the new Teſtament. But the new Teſtament hes not ſo mekle as one
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:20312:133"/> ſillabe of your ſacrifice of the Maſſe: therefore it could not be prefigured in the olde Teſtament. For if it were prefigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the ſacrifices of the olde Teſtament, it behooued ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be one with the ſpirituall ſacrifice of all Chriſtians, or elſe one with the bloodie ſacrifice of Chriſt vpon the Croce: for only theſe two ſorts of ſacrifices are prefigured in the old Teſtament, and recorded to bee fulfilled in the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but your ſacrifice of the Maſſe, is one with neither of them: for it is not one with the firſt ſort, for they are ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and you will haue it externall: neither is it one with the other of Chriſts ſacrifice vpon the Croce, for there he died, &amp; there he ſhed his blood, and there he ſuffered the tormentes of Gods wrath, and indignation for our ſinnes: and there he ſatisfied the iuſtice of God, and merited an euerlaſting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption to vs. But in your ſacrifice of the Maſſe, your
<note n="g)" place="margin">Ballarm. lib. 2. de miſſa. cap. 4.</note> ſelues graunts, that neither is he crucified, nor is his blood ſhed, nor ſuffers he the wrath of God for our ſinnes, <hi>nor ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies properly the iuſtice of God for the ſame, nor properly merites remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our ſinnes</hi> in the Maſſe: therefore it is not one with that ſacrifice of Chriſt vpon the Croce. For two ſeuerall actions whilk hes two different formes, &amp; are done in diuers times, and places, for diuerſe ends, cannot be one only, and the ſelf ſame ſacrifice: for it is the forme that giues a thing to be, and diſtinguiſhes it from all other things. But Chriſt his offering vp of himſelf vpon the croce, and your ſacrifice of the Maſſe hes different formes, are done in diuerſe places and times &amp; for diuerſe ends, therefore they cannot be both one. Further, if they were both one, then it ſhould follow, that as the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Chriſt vpon the Croce is of an infinite valure, ſo the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Maſſe ſhould be of the ſame valure. But <hi>Bellarm.</hi> ſayes,

                        <hi>That the ſacrifice of the Maſse, is but of a finite valour, and the ſacrifice of the Croce of an infinite valour.</hi> Therefore they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be both one and the ſelfe ſame ſacrifice: Therefore this ſacrifice of your Maſſe, ſeeing it is not one with neither of theſe two ſorts of ſacrifices, is not prefigured in the olde Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament.</p>

<note n="k)" place="margin">Heb 13.15 16 1. Pet. 2.5. Rom. 12.1. Rom. 15.16.</note> places. For either they ſpeake properlie and literally, or elſe figuratiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.

Or, if you will ſay they ſpeak figuratiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then, I ſay, they make nothing for your externall ſacrifice in the Maſſe, whilk you will haue to be a ſacrifice, not figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely, but properly.

                        <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> did offer vp bread and wine, in an externall ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. For the Scripture ſayes only, <hi>he brought it forth,</hi> whilk is not to ſacrifice. And it is certaine

<note n="(r)" place="margin">Heb. 7.</note> Apoſt. whereas he ſets down theſe things wherein <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> was a type of Chriſt, he does not ſo much as giue any inkling of this: for there he compares <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> with Chriſt: firſt, that as <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> was both King and Prieſt, ſo was Chriſt. Next, as <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> was with out father and mother, beginning, and ending, the Scripture not mentioning of it, ſo was Chriſt. Thirdly, as <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> was greater then <hi>Aaron,</hi> and had a more excellent Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode then the Leuiticall Prieſt-hoode, ſo was Chriſts. But neuer a word heir, of a ſacrifice of bread and wine, wherein <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> ſhoulde haue reſembled the ſacrifice of your Maſſe, as ye ſuppoſe. So you find out heir that whilk the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God found not out: and ſo ye make your ſelf wiſer then the holy Ghoſte in his Epiſtle. But we will learne not to bee <hi>wiſe aboue that whilk is written,</hi> and to ſearche no further, then the ſpirit of God hes found out already. And ſuppoſe it were graunted to you (whilk yee are neuer able to proue,) that <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> did offer vp bread and wine yet what to doe hes this with your diueliſh abhomination of your Maſſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ye ſay the ſubſtance of bread and wine is gone away, only the formes remayning. For if your ſacrifice in the Maſſe, be like the ſacrifice of <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> then the ſubſtance of breade and wine ſhould remaine as it did in the ſacrifice of <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedech,</hi> and the bread and wine ſhould be offered vp, and not Chriſts body and blood, as bread and wine only were offerd vp in <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> his ſacrifice, So then, either <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> his ſacrifice is not a tipe of your ſacrifice in the Maſſe, or els true bread and wine remaines in the ſacrament, and not Chriſt his bodie and blood whilk is offered vp. Chooſe you then, whether you will deny your ſacrifice to be according to the order of <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> or elſe will you let goe your reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, your Tranſubſtantiation, and your perſonal offering vp of Chriſt Ieſus in your abhominable Maſſe, for one you muſt doe. Thirdly, if Chriſt offered vp ſik a ſacrifice at his
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:20312:135"/> Supper, as was prefigured by <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> whilk you affirme heir,
<note place="margin">Ioh. 19.28.</note> then muſt it follow that Chriſt fulfilled that figure per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitely: and ſo the ſame ſacrifice needs no more to be offered vp againe, and ſo heir will followe the deſolation of your Maſſe-Prieſts, whoſe worke is chiefly in repeating of this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice againe. Fourthlie, I would aske you, Whether is this ſacrifice, whilk ye ſay he offered vp according to the order of <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> in his laſt ſupper, one with that ſacrifice whilk he offered vp vpon the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>oce, or not? If it be one, then, I ſay as he died and ſhed his blood on the croce, &amp; purchaſed an euerlaſting redemption by the ſame: ſo this ſacrifice of your Maſſe muſt be ioyned with his death, and ſhedding of his blood, and muſt haue the like vertue and effect to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme vs, and ſo two abſurdities will follow. The one, that Chriſt not only ſhould twiſe haue died, once in the Supper, and afterward vpon the croce: but alſo dies, and is crucified continuallie: in your Maſſe, &amp; yet the Scripture ſayes hee dyed but once. The other, that that ſacrifice of his vppon the croce is ſuperfluous: for what needed him to die againe to redeeme mankinde, ſince the firſte offering of himſelfe in the Supper was a ſufficient redemption. For if his ſacrifice vpon the croce was a ſufficient redemption, whilk you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny: and if the ſacrifice of him in the Supper be one with that: of neceſsitie it muſt followe, that as his ſacrifice v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the croce was a ſufficient redemption: euen ſo his ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in the Supper muſt be a ſufficient redemption for man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. And therefore
<note n="(s)" place="margin">
                           <hi>De</hi> euchat lib. 2. cap. 18.</note> 
                        <hi>Alanus</hi> a great defender of your Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick faith, ſaith, according to the iudgement of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Trent, <hi>that the new couenant is founded on the blood of Chriſt offered vp in the Supper, before he was crucified: and that Chriſt was truly our Paſſeouer the day before he ſuffered:</hi> and he ſayes, <hi>This is the foundation of all Chriſtian doctrine, according to the iudgement of the councell.</hi> Nowe if this be true, that he was our Paſſeouer, before hee died, and the couenant was founded in his blood whilk he offered vp in the Supper: then, certainly, Chriſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in vaine, whilk is more then blaſphemous: and ſo blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous muſt that doctrine of your Maſſe be, whilk carries
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:20312:136"/> with it ſik a blaſphemie. And if you will ſay, it is not the ſame with that ſacrifice vpon the croce: then, I ſay, firſt you are contrarie to your owne Kirk in this, who ſayes, it is one with that ſacrifice of the croce. Next, Chriſt his body and blood is not offered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the Supper: for his body &amp; blood was offered vp vpon the croce, and ſo your Maſſe is gone, or elſe make two Chriſts: one in the Supper vnder the formes of bread and wine, whilk the Diſciples ſawe not: and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who was offered vp vpon the croce, whilk was ſeene of all. So whether will ye go, and vnto what ſide will ye turne you, Maiſter Gilbert, for the vpholde of your Maſſe? for there are rocks and ſand beds on euery ſide. So neither did Chriſt offer vp himſelf in a ſacrifice at all in his laſt Supper, neither did he it according to the order of <hi>Melchiſedech.</hi> But now let vs ſee how ye proue this ſacrifice out of the inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And ſeing this point of doctrine is ſik a waightie point, as whereupon the ſaluation and damnation of ſoules does hing:
<note place="margin">The inſtitution of the Supper makes nothing for the ſacrifice of the Maſſe.</note> therefore I pray thee (Chriſtian Reader) deceaue not thine owne ſoule to thy euerlaſting perdition, but take good head what ground is in the inſtitution for this their ſacrifice, for if they prooue it not heir, it will neuer be prooued by the Scripture. You ſay therefore that <hi>Chriſt tooke bread and wyne,</hi> we grant that, yet heir is no ſacrifice. What then? <hi>Hee gaue thanks:</hi> yet heir is no ſacrifice. What next? <hi>He bliſſed it.</hi> Yet heir is no ſacrifice. And whereas ye ſay that by this bliſsing, and his heauenly wordes the breade and wine is changed in the body and blood of Chriſt: that I haue ſufficiently (as I hope) ouerthrowne in my anſwere vnto the fourth point of your doctrine in the firſt part. But to returne to the wordes of the inſtitution: after the bliſsing of the bread, whilk <hi>Luke</hi> expones <hi>by giuing of thankes:</hi> the text ſayes, <hi>He gaue.</hi> What gaue he but that whilk he tooke, and had bliſſed? And what tooke he, and bliſſed he, but the bread? And therefore the
<note n="t)" place="margin">1. Corinth 10.</note> Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>The bread whilk we bliſſe, &amp;c.</hi> So the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was bread whilk he gaue, and not his owne body and blood corporally. And vnto whome gaue he it? the text ſayes, <hi>Vnto his diſciples,</hi> both in <hi>Matthew, Marke,</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> all with one conſent. Now,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:20312:136"/> that whilk was giuen to his Diſciples was not properly offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp in a ſacrifice: for a ſacrifice is an offering to God. And the text ſayes heir, <hi>He gaue it to his Diſciples.</hi> So there is not a ſillabe in the inſtitution, that can make for your pretended ſacrifice.
<note place="margin">M. Gilbert addes to the inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on a new giuing, wherof the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture makes no mention.</note> You heir corrupt the word of Ieſus Chriſt wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully: for firſt you expone by <hi>Giuing, Offering vp in a ſacrifice.</hi> Next, whereas the Scripture in <hi>Matthew, Marke</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> hes but <hi>giuing</hi> once, and referres this <hi>giuing</hi> not to God, but to the Diſciples: <hi>And he gaue it to the Diſciples:</hi> you alledge heir <hi>two giuings:</hi> the one to God, whilk is your owne inuention, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Scripture makes no mention: the other to the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, whilk is the forme of a Sacrament and not of a ſacrifice:
<note place="margin">All the ground of the ſacrament of the Maſſe.</note> for a ſacrament is giuen to vs, a ſacrifice to God. So all the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of your ſacrifice of the Maſſe is two: the one is, your deuiſed Tranſubſtantiation: ſo one error leanes vpon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: the other is, not the words of Chriſt, <hi>And he gaue it to his Diſciples,</hi> but your owne wordes, and your owne expoſition only, <hi>And he gaue, or offered vp himſelf then for them.</hi> Theſe are your owne words, and not the words of the holie Ghoſt. So this ſacrifice of your Maſſe, hes not the words of Ieſus Chriſt as <hi>Matthew, Marke,</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> hes ſet them downe, to be the ground of it: but only your owne words, and your owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation. For howe dare ye be ſo impudent as to affirme that Chriſt gaue it twiſe: once in an offering for his Diſciples and another time in an ſacrament to his Diſciples, ſeing we will beleeue <hi>Matthew, Marke,</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> the ſworne pen-men of the holy Ghoſt, who ſayes only he gaue it to his Diſciples as a ſacrament, and makes no mention at all, that he gaue it to God as a ſacrifice. Doe you thinke the Lorde will neuer take an accompt of you for ſik a manifeſt lie of the ſonne of God, of his Scripture, of his Apoſtles and holy writers who write it, they all ſaying, <hi>he gaue it to his Diſciples,</hi> and you affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming beſide that giuing to them, that he <hi>gaue it,</hi> that is, <hi>offered it vp for them.</hi> O ſinfull man! Who will venter the ſaluation of his ſoule vpon ſo ſmall a threed: yea, vpon ſo impudent a lie, as ye make of the ſonne of God. O repent, or elſe you ſhall one day feill the fierceneſſe of the Lords hoat wrath &amp;
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:20312:137"/> indignation vpon your ſoule &amp; carcaſe for euermore. Leaue off therefore to be the cauſe of the damnation of ſoules, for you deceaue them, and makes them beleeue that this mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous abhomination of your Maſſe, hes Ieſus Chriſt to be the author of it, while it hes not ſo mekle as a ſillabe in the whole inſtitution, that giues ſa mekle as an inkling of it. Are you wiſer then the wiſeſt of your generation, <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who for all the arguments that he brings, neuer ſo mekle as once gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues an inkling of this your argument. For he thought it was too plaine a lie to affirme a double giuing heir, out of the wordes of the inſtitution: and too abſurd a expoſition to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone, <hi>He gaue,</hi> that is, <hi>he offered it vp.</hi> And therefore he hes no ſik reaſoning for his ſacrifice of the Maſſe. Yea, that whilk ye thinke is plaine out of the inſtitution that Chriſt offered vp his body and his blood in the ſupper: he ſayes,
<note n="(u)" place="margin">Bellar. lib. 1. de miſſa. cap. 12. fol 669.</note> 
                        <hi>that the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of offering cannot be eaſily diſtinguiſhed and ſeparated from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther actions whilk was done ioyntly there together, by the words of the inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> And more plainly he ſayes,
<note n="(x)" place="margin">lib. 1. de miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa c. 24. fol 706. The ſacrifice of the maſſe hes no expreſſe warrant in the inſtitution of the Supper by their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</note> 
                        <hi>that the Euangeliſtes hes not expreſly ſaide that Chriſt offered vp himſelfe vnto the Father in the Supper.</hi> This is a plaine ſpeaking: nowe your ſacrifice of the Maſſe, hes no expres warrand out of the inſtitution of Chriſt if you will beleeue him, whoſe controuerſies are allowed by the Pope to be printed. But it may be ye thought that this your doctrine would haue bene ſwallowed vp without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther triall, and therefore you regarded not what you write. You haue ſtollen your ſelfe in ſik credite with the ſimple a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you, who are deceaued &amp; blinded by your lies, that ye are not aſhamed to be plain ynough in ſpeaking vntruths and lies of the word of God. But the Lorde will recompence this one day. But now to returne to the reſt of the words of the inſtitution, as ye rehearſe them. And laſt of all ye ſay, <hi>Hee gaue his body and blood to his Diſciples to be eaten:</hi> He gaue it ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituallie, and they did eate it ſpirituallie: and he gaue the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of his body and blood, the bread and wine corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to them, and they did eate them corporally, ſuppoſe for a ſpirituall vſe and end. For that whilk he gaue they did eat: he gaue the bread and wine, therefore it was bread &amp; wine
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:20312:137" rendition="simple:additions"/> whilk they did eate, and drinke. And therefore the
<note n="(y)" place="margin">1. Cor. 11.</note> Apoſt. ſayes plainlie, <hi>for whoſoeuer ſhall eate of this bread, &amp;c.</hi> He calles it bread that is eaten. And our Sauiour ſayes
<note n="(z)" place="margin">Matth. 26.29.</note> 
                        <hi>Verely, verely from hence forth ſhall I not drinke of the fruite of this vine with you.</hi> That whilk he gaue his Apoſtles to drinke corporally in the latter Supper was the fruite of the vine, (ſo the Euangeliſtes ſaies.) But Chriſts blood was not the frutie of the vine: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was not his blood whilk they corporally dranke, but wine, whilk was the fruite of the Vine-tree. I goe forwarde. And when he had done this, ye ſay, <hi>He commanded his Diſciples,</hi> that is, <hi>the lawfull Paſtors of the Kirk to doe the ſame for the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of him to the end of the world.</hi> That is true, that whilk he did heir, he commanded to be done by his Diſciples to the end of the world: but neuer a ſillabe heir that he offered vp his bodie and blood vnder the formes of bread and wine in the Supper, in a propitiatory ſacrifice for the quick and the dead: Therefore he commanded not this ſacrifice of your Maſſe to be done to the end of the world. And whereas yee reſtrict this commandement, <hi>Doe this,</hi> only to the Paſtors, ye haue to vnderſtand that as there is ſome thing heir whilk Chriſt did, whilk is proper to them, as to be the diſpenſers of theſe heauenly myſteries: ſo there is ſome actions heir, whilk is common alſo with them to the people: as to receaue, to eate, to drink theſe Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of his body &amp; blood in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance. Seing therefore this commandement, <hi>Doe this,</hi> is to be referred to the whole actions of the Supper: and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there is ſome actions in the ſame, whilk the other Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſhould doe alſo: Therefore this commandement, <hi>Do this,</hi> is not to be reſtricted to the office of the Paſtors only, (whilk ye doe) but common with them to the actions of the people. Now to your concluſion: Seing (ſay ye) your Prieſtes does the ſame in this ſacrifice, whilk our Sauiour did: howe can I ſay that your religion in this, was not inſtituted by Chriſt.
<note place="margin">The preiſts in the maſſe doth not the ſame thing that Chriſt either command<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed or did him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in the latter Supper.</note> If ye doe the ſame that he did, indeed I will graunt you it. But you doe not the ſame whilk our Sauiour did: Therefore your religion in this is not inſtituted by Ieſus Chriſt. The whilk I prooue. Firſt, Chriſt took bread and wine in this Sacrament
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:20312:138"/> and gaue it to be eaten and drunken: and bread was eaten, &amp; wine was drunken by his Diſciples.
<note place="margin">The difference betwene the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Supper, and the abhominable ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Maſſe.</note> But your Prieſt takes bread and wine, &amp; coniures the ſubſtance of it away by your Tranſubſtantiation, and onely remaines the formes of the breade and wine behinde: therefore you doe not the thing whilk Chriſt did. Secondly, Chriſt tooke bread and brake it you take bread and hangs it vp, and keepes it in a boxe, to carrie to the ſeik, and in proceſsions. Thirdly, Chriſt tooke bread and gaue it to his Apoſtles: your Prieſts like gluttons in the ſacrifice of your Maſſe eates it vp euery whit himſelfe alone. Fourthly, Chriſt giues a Sacrament to ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gthen mens faith: but your Prieſtes giues a ſacrifice to redeeme mens ſoules. Fiftly, Chriſt gaue it to be eaten, your Prieſts giues it to be worſhipped. Sextly, Chriſt gaue bread, your Prieſtes ſay they giue God. Seuenthly, Chriſt gaue the Cupe to his Diſciples, ſaying, <hi>Drinke ye all of this,</hi> your Prieſt drinkes all himſelfe, and takes away the Cupe from the people, both in your ſacrifice and ſacrament. Eightly, Chriſt inſtituted the Supper, and commanded the Kirk to celebrate the ſame, as he had inſtituted it: but the Maſſe hes bene clamped vp by many ſundry Popes: one made the <hi>Confiteor,</hi> another the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troit:</hi> another the <hi>Kyriceleiſon,</hi> another the <hi>Gloria in excelſis:</hi> and ſo forth of the reſt, as ſhalbe prooued afterwarde. Ninthly, Chriſt intending to celebrate his Supper, changeth not his garment: but the Prieſt going to ſay his Maſſe, doth naught but cloth and vn-cloath, &amp; euery garment carrying a great myſterie. The Prieſt ſaying Maſſe muſte haue his head and beard ſhauen, and vpon his head a circle of haire, whilk they call a crowne: imitating the Prieſtes of the Gentiles in this, <hi>Baruh chap.</hi> 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 30. and not Chriſt and his Apoſtles. Tenth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Chriſt in the Supper vſed common bread, but the Popiſh Prieſt muſt expreſly vſe other manner of bread, baked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt two irons, whilk is properly, Wafers. Elleuenthlye, Chriſt made his Supper vpon a Table, the Popiſhe Prieſt muſt haue a conſecrate Altar, with ſome peeces of relickes put in the hole of it, or elſe a marble ſtone, in the borders whereof are little peeces of cloth, whilk they call <hi>corporales,</hi> to
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:20312:138" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſay his Maſſe on. Twelfthly, Chriſt in the celebrating of the Supper, preached &amp; taught his Apoſtles: the Popiſhe Prieſt mumbleth betwixt his teeth certaine praiers: he turneth to and from the altar, one while his back, another while his face to the people: now goeth he from one ſide of the altar vnto another: now he ſingeth with an high voice, now with a lowe voice: now he lifts vp his armes, now he caſteth them downe. Briefly, he ſeemeth to be a man whollie mad, not knowing what countenance for to vſe. Thirtenthly, Chriſt in the Supper ſpake in a vulgar tongue, that al might vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand: the Popiſh Prieſt in their Maſſes, ſpeakes in a ſtrange tongue, whilk the moſt part of themſelues vnderſtands not. Fourtenthly, Chriſt firſt brake the bread, and then gaue it to his Apoſtles: the prophane Prieſte firſt ſpeaketh certaine wordes ouer the bread in his Maſſe, and then breaketh it, (or the accidents of it, as they ſay) at their pleaſure. Fiftenthly, Chriſt after he had broken the bread ſayes, This is my body the Popiſh Prieſt ſpeakes the words, without breaking of the bread, and not content with the words of Chriſt, he addeth this word <hi>enim</hi> vnto them. Therefore you cannot M. <hi>Gilbert,</hi> but ſpeake againſt the light of your owne conſcience, when you ſay that your Prieſtes does the ſame in their Maſſe that Chriſt did in the Supper, and heir I appeale your conſcience before the terrible and euerliuing God, and before Ieſus Chriſt that ſhall iudge the quick and the deade, whether ye doe not ſpeake in this againſt the light of your owne conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or not, and whether your Prieſts in your Maſſe, does the ſame whilk Chriſt did in the Supper or not? Thinke you not that you muſt ſtand before the liuing God, and giue a reckoning of theſe things. Repent in time, and ceaſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue the ſoules of your countriemen any more. But to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this: What adoe hes your Maſſe with the Supper of Chriſt? what likeneſſe is there betweene the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? In the Supper whilk Chriſt inſtituted in the Scripture, we are remembred of his death &amp; paſsion vpon the Croce, whereby he appeaſed the wrath of God for our ſinnes, and of our duty towards him: whereby we acknowledge in our
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:20312:139"/> conſciences, that we are obliſhed to die to ſinne, ſeing it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooued the eternall ſonne of God by his death vppon the croce, to redeeme vs from the ſame: vpon the whilk ariſes an earneſt thankeſgiuing in the hearts and mouthes of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie true Chriſtian, for ſo great a ſaluation, purchaſed ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully, as by the death of the eternal ſonne of God. In your ſacrifice of the Maſſe is there any ſik thing? Is there any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his death and ſuffering there? Is his death ſhewen to the people in a knowne language that they may vnderſtand it? Is there any acknowledging of any dutie there, for his death? Is there any true thankeſgiuing there? No, none. But in ſtead of theſe, a heape of wordes in an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne language, and a diuerſity of Apiſh geſtures, &amp; Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhe and Iuglers tricks, to feede the eyes of the poore peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whilk neither the people, nor yet many of your ſelues do vnderſtand. In the Supper we are alſo admoniſhed of our ſpirituall coniunction with our neighbour, and of our duetie towards him, in that we are all partakers of one bread, made of many graines, and of one wine made of many grapes: to ſignifie vnto vs that we are all renewed and redeemed by one blood, members of one bodie, liuing by one ſpirit, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life, motion, &amp; feeling all from one head, being one with him, and ſo one with others, whereby followes our mutuall duties one toward another. In your Maſſe there is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the bread made of many graines, and of the wine made of many grapes, to ſignify this coniunction and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, either with Chriſt our heade or amongſt our ſelues, the Prieſt eating and drinking all himſelfe. In the Supper, according to Chriſt his inſtitution by giuing, taking, eating, and drinking of the breade and wine by all the Diſciples, whereby our bodily life is nouriſhed and ſtrengthned, is not only ſignified and repreſented our ſpirituall grouth in that ſpirituall communion with him, whereon our ſpirituall life depends: but alſo in the ſame, all the faithfull doeth truelie by faith eate and drinke ſpiritually his fleſhe &amp; blood, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are made one with himſelfe, fleſh of his fleſhe, and bone of his bones, whereby they are ſtrengthned in that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:20312:139"/> life, and confirmed in the hope of that glorie. But is there any ſik thing in your Papiſticall ſacrifice? Is there any giuing, and taking, eating, and drinking of bread and wine by the faithful, either to repreſent our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion with Chriſt and amongſt our ſelues, or to ſtrengthen vs in that ſpirituall life through his coniunction. Doe the poore people eate or drinke, either bodily, or ſpiritually in your Maſſe? Is there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny action there to ſtirre vp their conſcience? or any inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to incres their knowledge? Are they ought but idle be holders of a pretended myſtery, whilk is both dumb &amp; deaf, and of a Prieſt that eates and drinkes all himſelf alone? So that in ſtead of theſe heauenly diſhes, whilk our louing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doeth propine vnto vs, vppon his Table in the Supper, what is there in your abhominable ſacrifices, but a feeding with huskes, an apiſhe game, and Iuglers tricks to feede the fantaſies of poore people, that ſees but vnderſtands not, that heares, but they knowe not what. So that in trueth there is as great likeneſſe betwixt Chriſts Supper, and your Maſſe, as is betweene the Table of the Lorde,
<note place="margin">Some of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues hes confeſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed and written that al men may know it, that the Maſſe is but an vnwritten Tradi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion, and is not in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtituted by chriſt in the Scripture</note> and the Table of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels, and light with darkeneſſe. Seing therefore there is ſik a difference betwixt your ſacrifice in the Maſſe, and Chriſt his Supper, as hes beene ſeene: therefore your Prieſts does not the ſame in the Maſſe, whilk our Sauiour did in the laſt Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. And therefore howe can you ſay, that your religion in this is inſtituted by Chriſt? And this is ſo euident, that ſome of your owne Doctors and learned writers hes beene forced to confeſſe the ſame.

<pb n="229" facs="tcp:20312:140" rendition="simple:additions"/> in your communion, or rather abhominable ſacrifice of your Maſſe, (for how can it be called a Communion, where the Prieſt only eates and drinkes vp all?) there is no lawfull Miniſter: and ſeeing our offices is lawfull: to wit, the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpell, the adminiſtracion of Sacraments, and Diſcipline: and ſeing our entry to the offices is lawfull alſo: by dew examination of life and doctrine: and ſeing the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of our calling is from God, who enables whome hee calles with gifts meete to diſcharge the calling, and from his Kirk examining, trying, teſtifying, approuing, or dayning, &amp; conſenting vnto the ſame: Therefore in the adminiſtration of our Communion there are lawfull Miniſters. As to the ſecond, Thankeſ-giuing, we grant alſo it is compriſed in the inſtitution of Chriſt his ſacrament, and is required in the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of the ſame: But you ſay, our thankeſgiuing whilk we vſe is but an inuention of our own heads, as may be ſene in our Pſalme bookes.

                     <p>And as for the fifth a <hi>communicating</hi> we haue it, and that not only of the bread and wine, as ye here imagine, but of Ieſus Chriſt God and man, his verye fleſhe and blood, and al his bliſſings by faith ſpiritually: ſeing therefore we haue all theſe points whilk are requiſite in the inſtitution, a lawfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, thankſgiuing, bliſſing, giuing, and communicating: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee haue the true inſtitution of Chriſt in the ſacrament.

And I would aske this queſtion of you: What can be the cauſe, wherefore the typicall ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and all the rites and ceremonies thereof, is ſo expreſlye ſet downe in the Scripture of the old Teſtament, (whilk you will not deny) and this ſacrifice of yours, whilk yee account more excellent then all theſe, not to haue bene expreſly ſee downe in the newe Teſtament, neither the ſacrifice, nor the rites and ceremonies thereof, yea, not ſo meikle as the very name of it? Is the new Teſtament (thinke ye) more obſcure
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:20312:143"/> then the olde Teſtament? (whilk is abſurde to ſay.) Shall the olde Teſtament be cleare in ſetting downe the ſacrifices and all the rites thereof, whilk is but the ſhaddowe: and ſhould not the newe Teſtament, haue bene at the leaſt, as cleare in ſetting downe the ſacrifice of the newe Teſtament, whilk ye affirme to be the Maſſe, if it were ſik, what an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurde thing is this? Chriſtian reader aſſure thy ſelf, the Lord Ieſus would haue dealt as louinglie, and plainly with thee, in ſetting downe the ſacrifice of the Maſſe in the newe Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (if euer he had inſtituted ſik a ſacrifice) as he was in ſetting downe the ſacrifices of the olde Teſtament. But thou may aſſure thy ſelfe, and thy conſcience may leane vnto it, ſince he hath not ſo much as once expreſſed it in all the new Teſtament, therefore he hes neuer appointed it. Secondly, I ſay, in all the places of Scripture whereſoeuer the Apoſtles ſpeaks of the ſacrifices, whilk Chriſtians ſhould offer vp, they euer ſpeake of ſpirituall ſacrifices, and neuer ſpeakes of this their externall ſacrifice of the Maſſe. They neuer remember of this their ſacrifice, of the offering vp of Chriſt in the Maſſe Looke throughout the whole newe

Are you and your Maſſe-Prieſts more wiſe then the Apoſtles are? Whether ſhoule we then thinke &amp; ſpeake as they ſpak and thought, or as ye would haue vs? They ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſpak of your ſacrifice of the Maſſe, and bring one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, if ye can: therefore neither ſhould we. We will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue them rather then you. Thirdly, that doctrine whilk is expreſly gainſaide by the Scripture, muſt be falſe:) this you cannot deny:) but this your doctrine concerning the often and daily offering vp of Ieſus Chriſt, his body and blood in ſacrifice in your Maſſe, is expreſly gainſaid by the ſcripture: for the Scripture ſayes in ſundry places, that <hi>he hes once offred vp himſelfe,</hi> neuer to offer vp himſelfe againe, <hi>Heb</hi> 10.10. <hi>By the whilk will we are ſanctified, euen by the offering vp of Ieſus Chriſt once made.</hi> 11. <hi>And euery Prieſt ſtandeth daylie miniſtring, and oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times offereth one manner of offering, whilk cannot take away ſinne</hi> 11. <hi>But this man after he had offered one ſacrifice for ſinnes, ſitteth
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:20312:143"/> for euer at the right hand of God.</hi> 14. <hi>For with one offering hath hee conſecrated for euer them that are ſanctified. Heb.</hi> 9.24. <hi>Chriſt hes entred into the very heauen to appeare now in the ſight of God for vs, not that he ſhould offer himſelf often, &amp;c.</hi> 28. <hi>So Chriſt was once offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to take away the ſinnes of many. Heb.</hi> 7.27. <hi>Chriſt died once, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he offered vp himſelf,</hi> Seing the Scripture therefore affirmes ſo plainlie, that Chriſt <hi>once offered vp himſelfe,</hi> and you affirm that in your abhominable ſacrifice, he offers vp himſelfe often: ſince the Scripture ſayes, the offering vp of Chriſt is <hi>once only</hi> and ye ſay it is often in your Maſſe: Therefore this doctrine of yours is plaine againſt the expreſſe ſayings of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. For ſuppoſe ye will haue an vnbloody offering vp of Chriſt, yet the Scripture only acknowledges this bloody of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering vp of himſelf vpon the croce.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, I will aske you to what purpoſe ſerues the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall ſacrifice of Chriſt in your Maſſe? It muſt be for one of two: to wit, either to ſatisfy for our ſinnes, (and therefore ye call it a propitiatorie ſacrifice) or elſe to apply that ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on once made by his death vppon the croce vnto vs, (the whilk yee affirme alſo of it:) But for neither of theſe is Ieſus Chriſt to be offered vp againe: therefore for no cauſe is hee to be ſacrificed in your Maſſe. Not for the firſt, to ſatisfie for our ſinnes, becauſe the Scripture ſayes plainly, that he hes ſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tisfied for our ſinnes, by his once oblation vppon thh Croce, neuer to die againe, and therefore our Sauiour ſayes vppon the * Croce, <hi>It is finiſhed.</hi> And our redemption and ſatisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is aſcriued only to his death once made,
<note place="margin">Heb. 1. &amp; 9. &amp; 10 Ioh. 19.28. Bellar. lib. 1. do Miſſa. cap. 25</note> and his blood once ſhed. And your ſelues will not deny this, but the death of Chriſt is a ſufficient ranſome and ſatisfaction for all the ſins of the world, and therefore <hi>Bellarmine</hi> graunts this, that <hi>the vertue of his once offering vp vpon the croce, is infinite and euerlaſting, to ſanctifie vs: ſo that there needes not another ſacrifice of the croce, or the repetition of the ſame.</hi> And the treuth of this is manifeſt: for if Chriſt muſt be offered vp in the Maſſe to ſatisfie for our ſinnes, he muſt die againe, and ſuffer againe. For what is it to ſatisfie God, but to pay to God that whilk we owe? And what owe we vnto him for our ſinnes, but death: for death is the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:20312:144"/> ſtipend of ſinne? So that to ſatisfie God for our ſinnes, is to die for our ſinnes: and therefore we ſay, Chriſt hes once ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied for our ſinnes, becauſe he hes once payed our debt, whilk is death: that is, he hes once died for our ſinnes. So the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> either Chriſt hes not fully ſatisfied for our ſinnes, by his once death vpon the Croce, (whilk is impiety to thinke) or elſe the Lord craues a debt already payed, ouer againe: (whilk is blaſphemy) or elſe Chriſt needs not to be offered vp in your Maſſe, to ſatisfie for our ſinnes. And ſo your ſacrifice of the Maſſe availles not for to ſatisfie for our ſinnes.</p>
                     <p>Let vs come to the next: If ye will ſay, he is offered vp in the Maſſe for to apply the vertue of the death of Chriſt vnto vs, (whilk your Kirk alſo ſayes.) Firſt, I ſay, Chriſt is applyed to vs, when he is offered, not to God in a ſacrifice, but to vs in the word and Sacraments: therefore he ſhould not be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered vp to God in a ſacrifice, but offered to vs in his word &amp; Sacraments, that he may be applied to vs: for it is the worde and Sacraments whilk outwardlye applyes Chriſt and his death to vs, and not a ſacrifice: for in a ſacrifice the thing whilk is ſacrificed, is offered to God, and not applied to vs. Next, I ſay, if your ſacrifice ſerues but to apply the vertue of Chriſt his ſatisfaction vnto vs: then it is manifeſt, the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is alreadie made: for firſt the ſalue muſt be made, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it can be applied. So your Kirk heir erres, whilk ſayes your ſacrifice of the Maſſe is propitiatory to appeaſe the wrath of God, and alſo applicatorie to apply the ſame to vs. I ſay thirdly, if Chriſt ſhould be ſacrificed againe, that the vertue of his death may be made effectuall in vs: then alſo ſhould he be conceaued againe in the wombe of the Virgine borne againe, die againe, and riſe againe: that the vertue of his incarnation, birth, death, and reſurrection, ſhould be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed vnto vs: for will you ſay, that he muſt be ſacrificed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to apply the vertue of his ſacrifice vpon the croce vnto vs: and what reaſon then can ye pretend for you wherefore he ſhould not be incarnate againe, die againe, and riſe again that the vertue of theſe may be applyed to vs? Doe you think this abſurde? What is the cauſe then that ye will not bluſhe
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:20312:144"/> at the other. Fourthly, I ſay, if your ſacrifice of the Maſſe be an application of Chriſt his ſacrifice: then it is not the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice it ſelf: for the applying of the ſalue, is not the ſalue it ſelf: and therefore ſince you ſay that it is the applying of Chriſt his ſacrifice, wherefore ſhould ye ſay that Chriſt is ſacrificed in it: for theſe two cannot ſtand together. Fifthly, in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, the ſacrifice of Chriſt, and the vertue of his death is truely applyed vnto vs: and yet ye will confeſſe that Chriſt is not ſacrificed in Baptiſme. Wherefore then may not the vertue of this death and ſacrifice, be applyed to vs in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Supper, and yet he not ſacrificed againe in it. And laſt of all, neither you, neither any creature ſhoulde ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point or make moe meanes of the applying of Chriſt &amp; his death to vs, then is ſet downe in his word: but his word on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſets downe the inwarde operation of Gods ſpirit applying it to vs, and faith vppon our part apprehending it: and the worde the ſacraments, and diſcipline proponing and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the ſame vnto vs. But neuer a ſillabe in the whol ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that the Lord hes appointed your ſacrifice of the Maſſe to apply the death of Chriſt vnto vs. Seing therefore your ſacrifice of the Maſſe, neither ſatisfies for our ſins (for Chriſt by his death hes done that ſufficiently) nor yet applyes the ſatisfaction once made by the death of Chriſt vnto vs, (for that is done by the ſpirit and faith inwardly, &amp; by the worde ſacraments, and diſcipline outwardly, and that ſufficiently:) Therefore your ſacrifice of the Maſſe is needleſſe, and ſerues to no vſe in the earth.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, the Scripture euer conioynes with the ſacrifice of Chriſt, his death: ſo that he cannot be ſacrificed but by dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as the Scripture plainly teſtifies, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.25. and 26. <hi>Not that he ſhould offer vp himſelfe often, for then muſt he haue often ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the foundation of the world.</hi>

<pb n="238" facs="tcp:20312:145"/> ſayes plainly that he hes <hi>but once died,</hi> and I trow you wil not ſay that he is to die againe: Therefore ſeeing he cannot die againe, he cannot be offered vp againe: for the Scripture acknowledgeth no ſacrifice of Chriſt, but that whilk is ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with his death.</p>

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſacrificed, if your ſelues ſpeake true: or elſe as oft as he is ſacrificed in your Maſſe, he is alluterly deſtroied, whilk is blaſphemie.</p>
                     <p>Seuinthly, the ſcripture ſayes, <hi>Where ther is remiſsion of ſinnes there is no more offering:</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 10.18</note> that is, all externall propitiatory ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices ceaſes: but remiſsion of ſinnes is already obtained by the death of Chriſt, as the
<note n="b)" place="margin">Heb. 1.3</note> Scripture teſtifies, and your ſelues will not deny. Therefore there needes no more obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt in your Maſſe for the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Eightly, the
<note n="c)" place="margin">Heb. 9.22</note> Scripture ſaith, <hi>That without ſhedding of blood there is no remiſsion:</hi> but in your ſacrifice of the Maſſe there is no ſhedding of blood, as your ſelues graunts, for ye call it an vnbloody ſacrifice: therefore by your ſacrifice of the Maſſe there is no remiſsion of ſinne.</p>
                     <p>Further, the
<note n="(d" place="margin">Heb. 5. Heb. 7</note> Scripture acknowledges no other Prieſte of the new Teſtament, but Chriſt only, <hi>Theſe Prieſts</hi> ſayes the Apoſtle to the Hebrewes, ſpeaking of the Prieſts of the olde Teſtament, <hi>were many, becauſe death hindered them to indure: but he,</hi> ſpeaking of Chriſt, <hi>becauſe he abydes for euer, hes an euerlaſting Prieſt-hoode, whilk cannot paſſe from one to another.</hi> So Chriſt is the only Prieſt of the newe Teſtament. Now if it be true whilk you ſay, that Chriſt is offered vp in your Maſſe, and that by your Maſſe-Prieſtes, then are there moe Prieſts of the newe Teſtament then Chriſt, whilk is plaine againſt the Scripturs. What will you ſay to this? That Chriſt is the principal prieſt of the new Teſtament, and yours are ſecondary Prieſtes and
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:20312:145"/> vnder him, by whoſe miniſtry he offereth vp himſelf to God But firſt, was not the Prieſts of the old Teſtament onely ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condarie Prieſts? this you will not deny, ſeing their ſacrifices were figures of his, and their Prieſthood figures of his Prieſt hoode. But the Apoſtle oppones the Prieſthoode of Chriſt, not to another principall Prieſthoode, but to the Prieſthood of men, whilk was but ſecondary, and ſayes it cannot ſtande with that ſecondary Prieſthood in the olde Teſtament: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it cannot ſtand with your Prieſthoode of the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment. And the reaſon whilk the Apoſtle alledges will not only ſerue, to exclude the Prieſts of the old Teſtament, that was but ſecundary Prieſts alſo: but alſo all other ſacrificing Prieſts whatſoeuer, of the propitiatory ſacrifice of the newe Teſtament. For the reaſon is, becauſe <hi>he bydes for euer, and hes a Prieſthoode whilk cannot paſſe from one to another,</hi> whilk wil ſerue aſwell againſt your Maſſe-Prieſts, as againſt them: for they are mortall as the Prieſts of the old Teſtament were: and his Prieſthoode cannot paſſe from one to another, as it might haue done amongſt the Prieſts of the olde Teſtament, and alſo does amongſt your Prieſts. For to what purpoſe ſhould your Prieſthoode and ſacrifice ſerue, ſeing Chriſt his ſacrifice hes fulfilled al the types of all the ſacrifices of the olde Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? If you ſay, to ſignifie Chriſt his ſacrifice to come, as theirs did: then that is falſe, for he is ſacrificed already. But if you ſay, to ſignifie and repreſent his ſacrifice alreadie done: then I ſay, what needes him to be ſacrificed againe for that purpoſe? for the word and ſacramentes does repreſent him ſufficiently: and ſo your Maſſe needs not to repreſent his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. And if you ſay it repreſents his ſacrifice: then I ſay, it is not one with that ſacrifice of his vpon the croce, whilk you will be loth to graunt, for your Kirk ſaith, that it is one with that in ſubſtance. And I ſay farther,
<note place="margin">Bellar. lib. 1. de Miſſa, cap. 25</note> if you will ſay with <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine, That this place of the Apoſt. only excludes abſolutely the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication of Prieſts in the ſame dignitie and power with Chriſt:</hi> that then they exclude yours alſo. For if you offer vp the ſame ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice whilk he offered vp, then you haue the ſame power &amp; dignity whilk he had. But this you ſay you doe: for it is no
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:20312:146"/> matter of the difference of the manner, ſince the ſacrifice is one. Seing therefore Chriſt God and man, whilk ye ſay yee offer vp in your Maſſe is of that ſame dignity, whilk he was of, when he was offered vp vpon the croce: and ſeing the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall dignity of the ſacrifice makes the equall dignity of the Prieſt that offers it vp: therefore ſacrilegious are your Maſ-Prieſts, and excluded heir by the Apoſtle. And thirdly, I ſay, This is a vaine diſtinction of yours, of principall and chiefe Prieſt, and ſecondary Prieſts: for this is the nature of this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Chriſt that it cannot be offered vp by none, but by himſelfe. And fourthly, if your Maſſe-Prieſts be but Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in this ſacrifice, and Chriſt the principall, (as you ſay) who offers vp himſelf by you: then I ſay as ye offer vp Chriſt as inſtruments, for your ſinnes and the ſinnes of the people: it ſhould followe that Chriſt offers vp himſelf in your Maſſe by you, for his owne ſinnes, and the ſinnes of the people: But this is blaſphemie,
<note place="margin">Heb. 7.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>7.</note> and expreſly gainſaide by the Scripture. And laſt of all, I ſay, ſeing (as your Kirk ſayes) Chriſt his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice in the Maſſe is one with that ſacrifice vpon the croce: therefore as Chriſt offered himſelf vpon the croce, without the miniſtery of ſecondary Prieſts, ſo ſhuld he be offered vp in your Maſſe, without the miniſtrie of the ſame, or elſe it is not one with that. So your Maſſe-Prieſts are no waies to be called ſecondary Prieſts to Chriſt, except in that reſpect that <hi>Iudas,</hi> with the band of men of warre and hie-prieſts, were the inſtruments and miniſters of Chriſt his taking, death, &amp; crucifying: euen ſo you are the inſtruments and miniſters of the crucifying of Chriſt daylie in your Maſſe, ſo far as in you lyes: and in this reſpect brook ye your ſtile of Maſſe-Prieſts. And becauſe they haue a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon diſtinction in their mouths of a bloody and an vn-bloody ſacrifice: for they affirme that ſacrifice of Chriſt vpon the croce to be bloody, and that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of him in the Maſſe to be vn-bloody: Therefore I will take away this refuge &amp; vaine ſtarting hole from them. And firſt I ſay, this diſtinction of theirs of a bloody, &amp; vn-bloody ſacrifice of the ſelf ſame thing that is ſacrificed, wants al war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="241" facs="tcp:20312:146"/> whole new Teſtament as a ſillabe, that telles vs that there is a proper ſacrifice of Chriſt whilk is vn-bloody: and you ar neuer able to bring one inſtance to the contrary. Secondly, I ſay, it is repugnant to the Scripture:
<note place="margin">Heb. 10.10.11 12.14. Heb 9.24.25.</note> for the * Scripture on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledges ſik a ſacrifice of Chriſt as is ioyned with his death, as hes bene proued before. See <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24.25. <hi>Not that he ſhould offer himſelf often, for then ſhould he haue ſuffered often ſince the beginning of the world.</hi> Now if the Apoſtle his argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t be true, that Chriſt cannot be offered vp often, becauſe then he muſt die often: then this doctrine of yours is againſt the ſcripture, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſayes, Chriſt may be offered vp often, and yet not die often. But if you wil ſay, this is ſpoken of that bloody ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice: I graunt that: and I ſay the Apoſtle knewe not, nor neuer ſpak of another ſacrifice: and therefore your doctrine is vaine, that would haue another ſacrifice, then euer the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles in the whole Scripture hes made mention of. And I ſay thirdly, this diſtinction of yours cannot ſtand with your owne doctrine: for if there be a true ſacrifice of Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly in your Maſſe, as ye ſay, then his blood muſt be truely ſhed, and he muſt truelie die, (for this is the nature of all ſik ſacrifices for ſinne, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> graunts it) <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Miſſa, fol.</hi> 725. ſaying, <hi>If there bee not a true and reall ſlaughter of Chriſt in the Maſſe, then is not the Maſſe a true and reall ſacrifice:</hi> And alſo, <hi>In all true, real, and externall ſacrifices, the ſacrifice muſt be a thing ſenſible and muſt be made holy of a prophane thing,</hi> as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confeſſes: &amp; theſe conditions he requires in the definition of the ſame: but this, I hope, ye will not ſay of Chriſt: for he is holye al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, and is inſenſible in your ſacrifice, &amp; cannot be ſlaine againe: therefore properly there can be no true ſacrifice of Chriſt in your Maſſe, by your owne doctrine. To conclude this then: For theſe cauſes wee reiect this abhomination of your Maſſe. Firſt, becauſe Chriſt cannot be offered vp in a ſacrifice, but he muſt die alſo, as hes bene prooued, and the Scripture teſtifies that he hes once died, and all chriſtians confeſſes it. Secondly, becauſe the death of Chriſt is a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſatisfaction for our ſinnes, and ſo we neede not that he ſhould be offered vp againe to ſatisfie for the ſame. Thirdly,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:20312:147"/> becauſe the ſpirit of Chriſt and faith, by the outward means of the word &amp; ſacraments &amp; cenſures, is a ſufficient meane to apply him to vs, and ſo wee neede not the ſacrifice of the Maſſe for that end. Fourthlye, becauſe Chriſt onely is the Prieſt of the new Teſtament, who hes no ſucceſſors, &amp; whoſe Prieſthood cannot paſſe from one to another, becauſe he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues for euermore, and he only can be ſacrificed by himſelf, &amp; therfore he only can offer vp himſelf, whilk he hes once done vpon the croce. Fifthly, becauſe the ſacrifice of Chriſt vpon the croce is perfite, and the vertue of it indures for euer, and it cannot, nor ſhould not be reiterate. Sextly, becauſe the Scripture propones Chriſt now ſitting in glorie at the right hand of his Maieſty, and not vnder the formes of bread and wine in your ſacrifice. And ſeauenthly, becauſe it is but the deuiſe of man, wanting God to beare witneſſe to it in the Scripture, repugnant to that only one ſacrifice of his vppon the croce, aboliſhing the frutes of his death and paſsion, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſacrament of the Supper, in abhominable idolatrie, cauſing men to worſhip a bit of bread, as the ſonne of God: and laſt, becauſe it ſpoiles men of the fruite of the ſacrament Therefore in all theſe reſpects it is abhominable, to be dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, and in no ſort to be communicated with.</p>

And what Chriſtian harte can think that theſe prayers can be applyed to him without horrible blaſphemy: as to duſt &amp; aſhes to interceed by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to God the Father for his beloued Sonne,

                  <p>Now let any Chriſtian hart iudge whether theſe praiers

                     <note place="margin">Clemeus lib. 3 cap. 17</note> that is, <hi>for the gift whilk is offered vp, That it would pleaſe God to receaue it in his altar, through the interceſsion of his Chriſt, in a ſweete ſmelling ſauour,</hi> whilk no waies can be applied vnto the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the ſonne of God. For heir they are manifeſtly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, the gift offered, and the interceſsion of Chriſt for the whilk they deſire God to accept of the gift offered. So heir is a moſte notorious corruption, wherein they apply all the praiers, whilk were firſte conceaued and made of the gifts &amp; preſents of the people, whilk they offered vp to God in the Sacrament; to the pretended ſacrifice of the ſonne of God.
<note place="margin">The degrees of this change and corruption</note> And from the offerings of the people whilk was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, they paſſe to an oblation whilk was offered: for a ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of praiſe, to a ſacrament whilk the Prieſt conſumeth all himſelfe: from a ſacrament to confirme vs of our ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Chriſt, to a propitiatorie ſacrifice of the ſonne of God, for the redemption of ſoules: and from a commemoration of the death of Chriſt in the ſacrament, to a reall immola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and offering of him vp againe, and that not for the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing only, but for the dead alſo.</p>
                  <p>By theſe degrees then hes this monſtrous ſacrifice beene conceaued formed, receaued life, and brought forth into the world. Nowe many other things did concurre to the ſtren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening of her, and the rooting of her in the hearts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of men: as firſt the word <hi>ſacrifice,</hi> whilk was freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lie vſed by the Fathers of the Primitiue Kirk,
<note place="margin">What things con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>curred to the ſtrengthening of her, and rooting her in the hartes of men after ſhe was borne.</note> taken from the olde Teſtament, and the typicall ſacrifices there, whilk they aſcriued vnto the ſacrament of the Supper, calling it a ſacrifice. And that firſte, becauſe it was celebrated with
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:20312:154"/> thankeſgiuing, whilk are called <hi>the ſacrifice of praiſe.</hi> Next, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>they ſacrificed themſelues in a holy, liuely,</hi>

The next was the vniuerſall ignorance, both of Paſtours and people,
<note place="margin">The vniuerſall ig<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>norance both of Paſtor and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple through the inundation of bar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>barous nations</note> through the barbarous nations of the <hi>Gotthes, Hunnes,</hi> &amp; <hi>Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dales,</hi> whilk ſpoiled &amp; waſted the empire of the Weſt, more then 100. yearefull, whereby all learning (almoſt) was buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and the lights and toarches of the Kirk being exſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, their ſucceſſors beeing borne and brought vp vnder that barbaritie, in that common &amp; publick ignorance, they were ſo far from chaiſsing away that darkneſſe, that they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther increaſed the ſame, being giuen altogether to ſeculare and worldly affaires, as the lawes of <hi>Charles</hi> the great do te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie: commanding them <hi>that they ſhould abſtaine from ſeculare affaires from the Court, from warres, from Falconry from lechery, from games.</hi> Thirdly, the corruption of languages whilk entered in with theſe barbarous nations at that ſame time,
<note place="margin">3. The coruption of languages</note> through the mixture of people of ſundry languages: wherby firſt the language became barbarous: next, not vniuerſally vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. And certainlye were not this, Satan could not haue preuailed ſo meikle, in cauſing this poiſon of this monſtrous ſacrifice to be ſo vniuerſally drunken out by the people. For if they had vnderſtood the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guage, theſe words whilk they daily heard in their ſeruice, <hi>Surſum corda, Liſt vp your heartes: And ſhew forth the death of the ſonne of man, and confeſſe his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection till his comming.</hi> Theſe wordes might eaſily haue kept them in this knowledge, that Chriſt was aboue, and they ſhould not ſeeke him bodily in the ſacrament, becauſe hee was not there really preſent, but was to come: and that the ſacrament was not a reall offering of the ſonne of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, but a ſhowing foorth of his death, vntill his ſeconde comming.</p>
                  <p>But two doctrines eſpecially, whilk by proceſſe of time
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:20312:155"/> alſo entered in the Kirk of God,
<note place="margin">4. The doctrine of Tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp; Purgatorie brought her to her full perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſtrength.</note> brought this pretended ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of their Maſſe, to her full perfection and ſtrength: the one was the doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> that the bread and wine in the ſacrament, by the words ſpoken, or rather mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by the Prieſt, was changed in the body and bloode of Chriſt. From time this was taught the people, then what followed but all adoration and worſhip to bee giuen to the ſacrament, where Chriſt is really preſent. Then how coulde it be but a propitiatory ſacrifice for the ſinnes of the liuing, ſeing it was that ſelf ſame body and blood, vnder the formes of bread and wine, whilk was offered vp vpon the Croce for the ſinnes of the worlde. The next was that of <hi>Purgatorie,</hi> for ſeing (ſay they) that there is a fire of Purgatory after this life, where through men muſt paſſe to heauen: and ſeeing in theſe flames their ſinnes muſt be purged: therefore a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die muſt be fore-ſeene: and where is there a remedy to bee found, but in the ſacrifice of the Maſſe, where the ſon of God is offered vp, that will releeue our ſoules after we are depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? Theſe will helpe the ſoules of our Parents and friends that are there alreadie. Vppon the whilk was founded the Maſſes and ſacrifices for the deade: and from thence came the moſt part of the donation of lands to the Kirks, to haue Maſſes ſaide for their ſoules.</p>
                  <p>So then, to conclude, the loſſe of the communion in the ſacrament of the Supper,
<note place="margin">The concluſion</note> next the ſanctification of the obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the people, whilk at laſte was turned to that whilk the Prieſte conſumed himſelfe alone: thirdly, the aua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice of the Prieſtes whilk bred their damnable doctrine, that the Supper was not only a ſacrament, but a ſacrifice, &amp;c fourthly, the applying of the praiers conceaued of the giftes of the people, vnto the rounde hoſt and Challice, whilk the Prieſt conſumed: fifthly, the abuſing of the word ſacrifice, whilk the fathers and Kirk vſed: ſextly, the publick and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſall negligence and ignorance of Paſtor and people: ſeauenthly, the confuſion of languages: and laſt of all, their damnable doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation and Purgatorie: Theſe were the degrees by the whilk their abhominable ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:20312:155"/> hes bene created, nouriſhed, entertained and perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in that meaſure and ſtrength: that at the laſt it tooke ſik deepe roote in the hearts of all men almoſte, that nothing could roote it out, except only the power of the Lords ſpirit by the voice of his word.

And ſeeing praier is a honor only due to God, and Ieſus Chriſt is our only Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator and interceſſor: therefore this praier to Saints depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted is both idolatrous, and iniurious to Chriſt his interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and mediation.

Next, that whilk is only proper to Ieſus Chriſt, to his death, merites, and interceſsion, to make the Father merciful vnto vs, and to make him to forgiue vs our ſinnes, is taken from him heir, and communicate vnto the virgine <hi>Marie,</hi> and the
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:20312:158"/> merites of al the hee Saints &amp; ſhe Saints: and whilk is moſt horrible, vnto the ſigne of the Croce: that by her interceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, their merites, and the help of the ſigne of the Croce, God might haue mercy. What horrible idolatry is this, to ioyne ſik helpers to the ſonne of God, who is a perfite Sauiour. To ioyne the merites of fleſh and blood, to his merites, as thogh his were not ſufficient to obtaine ſaluation. And as though men were not only able to merite eternal life to themſelues but alſo had ſik aboundance of merites that they ſerued to obtaine mercie for others: and ſo not only to make them ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours of themſelues, but of others alſo. And that whilk is yet more horrible idolatry and blaſphemy, (if worſe can be) to ioyne with him the helpe of the ſigne of the Croce. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in their Breuiarie they ſay, <hi>Keepe vs Lorde with thy peace, &amp;c. whome thou haſt redeemed by the tree of thy holy Croce.</hi> And in a hymne, <hi>O Croce, haile O Croce, only hope, increaſe, righteouſneſſe to the godlie, and forgiue the guiltie.</hi> And in their breuiarie they ſay, <hi>We adore thy Croce ô Lord.</hi> Now what is it to mock God, if this be not: to ſubſtitute creatures, yea a very ſtock and a tree in the roome of the ſonne of God, and to aſcriue rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vnto it: and to pray for righteouſneſſe and remiſsion at the ſame, to adore it, and to call it their onely eſperance?

                     <p>The ſext abuſe is in the prayer that the Prieſt ſayes when he offers his hoſte vpon the altar, <hi>Receaue holy Father this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate ſacrifice whilk I offer vnto thee, for my owne ſinnes, and for the ſinnes of all the faithfull, both liuing and dead, that it may profite to mee and them to ſaluation and euerlaſting life.</hi> And he praies the like when he offers the challice vpon the altar, <hi>That it may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend in the preſence of his maieſtie, for the ſaluation of him and of all the worlde.</hi> Wherein the Prieſt commits horrible blaſphemy
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:20312:159"/> in aſcriuing remiſsion of ſinnes and redemption, to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of bread and wine, for as yet the words of conſecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are not pronounced: and ſo by their owne confeſsion they are yet but bread and wine: and yet the Prieſt ſayes, he offers it to God for the ſinnes of the quick &amp; dead, and for the ſaluation of the world. Nowe what blaſphemie is this to aſcriue that to the ſacrifice of bread and wine, whilk by their owne confeſsion is not changed yet in Chriſts body and blood, whilk is only

Next, that he offers this ſacrifice for the ſaluation of the dead ſeing the elect departed are in heauen, and ſo they need no ſacrifice for them: and the reprobate departed are in hel, ſo no ſacrifice will auaill them. And as for Purgatory whilke they dreame of, the Scriptures knowes not ſik a thing.

                     <p>The ſeauenth abuſe is their magicall bleſsing of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, after the manner of ſorcerers, without the warrand of the worde, and the vertue whilk the Prieſt praies for, that it may chaiſe away the diuel, make whole euery diſeaſe: whilk hes no more vertue then their Exorciſmes and adiurations, whilk the Prieſt makes in Baptiſme, and in their other ſerui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces, by their holy water, by their lighted candles, their oiles, annointings, and other like ceremonies. And in this cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony they either Iudaize: for the Iewes vſed this ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of incenſe vnder the law, to figure the ſweet ſauour of the ſacrifice of the ſonne of God to his Father: and ſo makes the death of Chriſt of no effect to them: or elſe they followe the cuſtome of the old
<note n="b)" place="margin">Alex. ab Alex. lib. 4. cap. 17</note> Romane idolaters.

                     <p>The eight abuſe is, in that they make their Maſſe a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall of Chriſt his incarnation, circumciſion, reſurrection, &amp; aſcenſion: and that they celebrate the ſame to the honor of
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:20312:160"/> others then to God: to wit, to the honor of the Virgine <hi>Mary</hi> and of all the Saints, whilk is horrible blaſphemie, to giue that whilk is Gods glorie to his creatures.

                     <p>The nynth abuſe (paſsing by their monſtrous Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, whereof I haue ſpoken in another place) is their round hoſte, taken from the vſe of the old

                     <p>To prooue this by ſome examples, that by their owne do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine they make the people to commit idolatry in worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their breaden God. About the yeare 1536. there was foure <hi>Auguſtine</hi> Friars, hanged in <hi>Ciuil</hi> in <hi>Spaine,</hi> who had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly by night murthered their Prouinciall.

And therfore, all theſe that heard their Maſſe that day, by their owne do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine committed Idolatrie, becauſe there was no conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there. I will ſet downe another example. There was a certaine Prieſt who being depoſed for his filthie life, wherin he had continued for the ſpace of 30. yeares with a harlote: beeing demanded by one, if he had truely repented him of this his abhominable life, and if he had put away this his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

At the laſt, he confeſſed, that to auoide the vnworthie receauing of the body &amp; blood of the Lord, he did not pronounce the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tal words wherwith it is conſecrate. And being vrged againe, how he durſt commit ſo horrible a wickedneſſe, as to giue ſo great an occaſion of ſo horrible idolatrie to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: who kneeling on their knees, caſting themſelf on the earth, lifting vp their hands towards the altar, ſtriking their breaſtes, did worſhip the vn-conſecrated bread and cupe. Vnto whome he anſwered, that it was not ſo great a fault as hee ſaide of it: and that hee was not allone, but many moe did the ſame, whilk thought it not ſo abhominable an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, as he made of it. Theſe two hiſtories I finde written by a Spaniſhe authour, one <hi>Cyprian Valera,</hi> the title whereof is, Of the Pope and his authority, &amp; of the Maſſe &amp; the holines thereof. All theſe than that heard the Maſſes of theſe men, and adored the ſacrament whilk they lifted vp, committed idolatrie by their owne Canons and decrees: for the laſt did not pronounce the words of conſecration, &amp; the other foure had not the intent to conſecrate: and therefore there was no Tranſubſtantiation there, by their owne doctrine, &amp; ſo they worſhipped bread and wine as their great redeemer &amp; cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator. But what a miſerable religion is this, that depends vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the intention of another: and therefore who can be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, by their owne doctrine, whether it be God they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip or not in their ſacrament. And this made a certaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitor, an enemy to the trueth, fearing when hee heard Maſſe, whether the Prieſt had intention to conſecrate or not to ſay, O Lord, if thou be there I adore thee: and ſo by this ſubtelty he thought to eſcape committing of idolatry. In the time of the Councell of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> there was three Popes that the Councell for their abhominations did depoſe, &amp; elected another: theſe three not beeing Popes coulde not ordaine Prieſts, nor giue them authority to conſecrate: ſo that by their owne Canons, all they that heard Maſſes of ſik Prieſtes
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:20312:162"/> as had their authority from them, committed idolatry. This ſame may be ſaide of them that heard the Maſſes of all theſe Prieſtes that were ordained by Pope <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the firſt, and the whoore Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the 8. For neither of theſe had power to ordaine Prieſtes by their owne Canons. And as for Pope <hi>Iohn,</hi> there is no controuerſie of it, becauſe ſhe was a woman, not capable of that authority by their owne Canons. And as for <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the firſt, he was a laick man, who without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing any orders was by force named Pope. He not being a Prieſt himſelf, could not giue this authority to others. And ſo by their owne doctrine, all theſe that heard the Maſſes of ſik Prieſts did commit horrible idolatry. And howſoeuer the Pope and his Cleargie affirmes it to be God, and not bread and wine, whilk they adore; yet ye ſhall ſee what eſtimation they haue themſelues of that breaden God of theirs, by ſome examples. Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſeauenth, vſed it for coniuratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and ſought a reſponſe of it, and becauſe it woulde giue him none, he caſte it in the fire, and burned it, and ſo burned his Creator. They vſe it to reuenge their wrongs, hatred and malice by it: and therfore Pope <hi>Victor</hi> the third in the yeare. 1088. was poiſoned in the Challice by his ſub-deacon. Sik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the archbiſhop of Yorke, poiſoned in the Challice. Sik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeauenth, poiſoned by a Dominican Friar in the Sacrament. They vſe it for an Haruenger, ſending it one or moe daies iourney before, with the baſeſt ſort of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The Dominican Friars of the towne <hi>Auferra</hi> in France in the yeare 1536. did burne it, being vomite out by a Fria<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> that ſaide Maſſe. And the Franciſcans <hi>de alia Villa</hi> burnt the Cow whilk had eaten vp the ſacrament out of the Prieſtes hand, and ſo in burning her, did burne their Creator with her. <hi>Molon,</hi> one of the Spaniſh inquiſition, 35. yeeres ſince, being to goe into proceſsion vpon the day of <hi>Corpus Chriſti,</hi> &amp; the hoſte that was to be put in the boxe, beeing ſo great that it could not be placed in the ſame, he being impatient to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waite whill another hoſte had bene conſecrate, demanded ane paire of ſheares, and clipped his God and Creator: and ſo went on forewarde to their proceſsion. Of the whilk we
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:20312:163"/> gather two things. Firſt, that their Popes and Eccleſiaſtical rable is without all God and religion, that makes ſo light of their God as to clip it and burne it, and vſe it as the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their mallice &amp; reuenge. Secondly, that this conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate bread of theirs whilk they ſell to the people to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiped and adored is moſte abhominable Idolatry, whereof one day they ſhall giue a reckoning to God: and thus much for the tenth abuſe of their idolatrous Maſſe.</p>

<pb n="273" facs="tcp:20312:163"/> may ſanctify his Sonne and accept of him; as though he were not fully ſanctified in him ſelfe, and were not the fountaine of all holines to others, and as though the Father were not well pleaſed in him alreadie. And becauſe the Maſſe-Preiſt vantes that in his ſacrifice of the Maſſe he offers vp the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſonne of God in a ſacrifice to his Father for the ſinnes of the quick and dead, I will aske him this: doth not hee blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme horribly, who vants that in ſome thing that he does hs is more acceptable to God, nor Ieſus Chriſt is? This can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied. But I aſſume that the Preiſt vantes that in his Maſſe he is more acceptable to God, nor Ieſus chriſt is: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Prieſt is a horrible blaſphemer. And I proue the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption thus: The Prieſt vaunts that in his Maſſe he offers vp Ieſus Chriſt to God his Father: the Prieſte alſo in the Maſſe praies the Father, that he would ſanctifie and accept of his ſonne whilk he offers vp: Therefore the Prieſt vaunts y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is more acceptable to god in the Maſſe, nor Ieſus Chriſt is: for God regardes more the perſon that offers vp, then the thing that is offered vp. This is <hi>Irenaeus</hi> language:
<note place="margin">Irenaeus lib. 4. contra haereſ. Valent. cap. 34</note> and for this purpoſe he brings forth the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples of <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Cain,</hi> &amp; their ſacrifices. For he ſayes, <hi>They two offered vp to the Lorde, but they were not both accepted of him: for Abell his ſacrifice pleaſed God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his perſon pleaſed him, and that becauſe of his faith: but the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Cain pleaſed not God, becauſe his perſon pleaſed him not, and that becauſe of his incredulity.</hi> Seing therefore that the Maſſe-Prieſt vaunts that hee offers vp Ieſus Chriſt in his Maſſe to the Father: and ſeing the Prieſt muſt be more acceptable the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your ſacrifice: Therefore it muſt follow that the Prieſt in the Maſſe vaunts, that he is more acceptable to God then Ieſus Chriſt is, and ſo is a horrible blaſphemer in his Maſſe.</p>
                     <p>The thirteenth abuſe is, that he compares the ſacrifice of the ſonne of God, with the ſacrifice of <hi>Abel, Abraham,</hi> &amp; <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedech,</hi> whilk by infinite degrees ſurpaſſeth them all.</p>

And ſo theſe are manye voiages whilk ye cauſe Chriſt to make: Firſt, to deſcend from heauen by the meanes of your Tranſubſtantiation, then to make him to aſcend to heauen by the meanes of your praier and then laſt of all, to make him againe deſcend from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, that yee may eate him and drinke him.

                     <p>The twentieth abuſe, is their manifold ſtiles and titles that they giue to their Maſſe, whilk cannot be all aggreeable to the ſame: ſome taken from the perſons in whoſe name and honor they are celebrate: as <hi>the Maſſes of the Trinity, of the name of Ieſus, of his croce, crowne, and fiue wounds, of our Lady, of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, of the Saints:</hi> ſome taken from the perſons and matters wherefore they are ſaide. For there are ſundry ſorts of Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, for ſundry ſortes of perſons and matters; as one <hi>for the Pope, another for the Emperour, the third for the King, the fourth for a man,</hi> 5. <hi>for a woman.</hi> 6. <hi>for the bridegrome.</hi> 7. <hi>for the bride.</hi> 8. <hi>for Priſoners.</hi> 9. <hi>for them that ſailles.</hi> 10. <hi>for them that goes a voyage.</hi> 11 <hi>for the dead.</hi> 12. <hi>for him of whoſe ſoule there is doubt.</hi> 13. <hi>for the peſt.</hi> 14. <hi>for the rage.</hi> 15. <hi>for the tempeſt.</hi> 16. <hi>for the fire.</hi> 17. <hi>for all ſortes of diſeaſes both of man and beaſt.</hi> And laſte of all, ſome of their ſtiles are taken from the diuerſity of times and ſeaſons wher in they are ſaide: one ſort of Maſſe for Sommer, another for Winter: one for the time of lent, another for the time of fleſhe: one for Chriſt-mas, another for Paſche, another for Whitſonday, &amp; other ſome for other feaſt daies. Nowe theſe Maſſes are ſo diuerſe, that the Maſſe that is ſaide at one of theſe ſolemne times, cannot ſerue for another: the Maſſe for lent, cannot ſerue for the time of fleſhe: the Maſſe for Paſch cannot ſerue for Chriſtmaſſe, and ſo forth of the reſt. In the whilk there are many horrible abuſes. Firſt, if the Maſſe be one with the Supper (as they ſay) then as there is but one Supper of the Lord, whilk is inſtituted only for the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:20312:166"/> of Chriſt, whilk is but one in generall for all: &amp; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of all the faithfull are partakers, of whatſomeuer ranke they be: be they great, be they ſmal, be they riche, be they poore; and whilk ſerues for all times. For, as our Sauiour did inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute but one Baptiſme to ſerue for all perſons, &amp; for al times ſo he did inſtitute but one Supper to ſerue for all perſons &amp; all times. If therefore the Maſſe were one with the Supper, it ſhould be but one for all perſons, and for all ſeaſons. But this diuerſitie of Maſſes does teſtifie that it is not the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of Ieſus Chriſt, but the inſtitution of Antichriſt, &amp; that it is not one with the Lord his Supper, as they falſly alledge: Yea, it doth teſtifie that they haue forſaken the truth of God and are giuen ouer of God to beleeue lies, and to be decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by ſtrong deluſions, that they might be damned.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, what needes ſeuerall Maſſes of the Trinity, of the holy ſpirit, of the name of Ieſus? for ſeeing the three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Trinity are one, &amp; they all concurre in the worke of our faith, the Father giuing his ſonne by his holy ſpirite in the word and ſacraments: therefore this diuerſity as thogh the perſons of the Trinitie were ſeparate, is needleſſe.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, this woulde be marked: that ſuppoſe they haue ſtiled their Maſſes from ſundry perſons, yet they haue not aſcriued a ſingulare Maſſe to Ieſus Chriſt, that it might bee named ſimplie the Maſſe of Ieſus Chriſt: and this, no queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not without the prouidence of God, that ſeeing the Maſſe is not the inſtitution of Chriſt, but of Antichriſt; not the ordinance of God, but of Sathan: he would not that ſik a blaſphemous and idolatrous inuention ſhoulde haue the ſame ſtile to be called the Maſſe of Chriſt ſimplie, without any further addition, as the Supper is called the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.

Either therefore theſe ſentences that are ſpoken of him are falſe, or elſe all Maſſes ſaid for him are ſuperfluous. 8. if the Maſſe be one with the Supper, then as the Supper was only inſtituted for the liuing, and not for the dead: and therefore our Sauiour in the Supper commands, <hi>To take eate, drinke, and to doe it in remembrance of him,</hi> whilk the dead cannot doe: ſo theſe Maſſes ſhould not be for the dead. And for what dead are theſe, that theſe Maſſes are ſaide? If they ſay, for them that are in heauen or hell: I anſwere, the one needes them not, and they are vnprofitable for the other. If they ſay, for them that are in Purgatorie: I anſwere, this Purgatorye is but their owne inuention, to draw water to their owne mil, and to enriche the Popes treaſures, for the Scripture makes no mention of it. Ninthly, their Maſſes that are ſaid for them that are abſent, as for the Priſoners, for them that ſailles, &amp; are in their voiage, &amp;c. makes it manifeſt alſo, that the Maſſe is not one with the Lords Supper: for it was inſtituted not to them that were abſent, but to them that were preſent. For in the Supper they are commanded to take, eate, and to drinke in remembrance of him, whilk the abſent cannot do.

Next, the Lordes Supper was not inſtituted to be a charme for ſik diſeaſes of man or beaſt, or for the fire, peſt, tempeſt, &amp;c. but for the remembrance of Chriſts death.

<note place="margin">This title of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uand of ſeruands will not excuſe him, being indeid the title of cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Cham, for he is called the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uand of ſeruands and ſo fit in the Lords iuſt proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for your Popes who is that man of ſin.</note> if another (ſaies he) ſhall come in his owne name, him ye will receaue.

Nowe it is out of all controuerſie that the Iewes neuer receaued the Pope: Therefore the Pope is not the Antichriſt. Againe, the Pope came neuer in his owne name but in the name of Chriſt, for he is called the Vicare of Chriſt, and the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uand of the ſeruands of God: therefore he cannot be the Antichriſt.</p>

                  <p>Let vs ſee then how he defends him from being the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, and then you ſhall heare our reaſons to the contrary. You aske wherefore I ſet not down ſome places of Scripture to proue the Pope to be the Antichriſt: I anſwere: not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I could not, but becauſe it was not my purpoſe at that time. But nowe I minde to doe it (God willing) after that I haue anſwered to your arguments. Your firſt reaſon is, The Iewes ſhall receaue the Antichriſt: but they neuer receaued the Pope: therefore the Pope is not the Antichriſt. I anſwer: Your Propoſition I deny, that the Iewes ſhall receaue the Antichriſt. For firſt I will aske you, Are you of that opinion with <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> the Rhemiſts, and the reſt of your Cleargy,
<note place="margin">Bella 1. lib. 3. de Rom. Pont. cap. 12.. Rhemiſt. annot. vpon 2 Theſ. 2 The Iewes ſhuld not receaue the antichriſt as their Meſsias.</note> that they ſhall receaue him as their <hi>Meſsias,</hi> whilk they looke for? If you be not of their minde, then beſide that you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from the doctrine of your owne Kirk, it is not probable that the Iewes woulde receaue him, if they thought not hee were their Meſsias. And if ye be of their minde, then I ſay, the Iewes will receaue none as their <hi>Meſsias,</hi> but theſe who are borne of the tribe of <hi>Iuda,</hi> and the family of <hi>Dauid</hi> in <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem,</hi> and who ſhall reigne in <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> But the tribes are confounded, ſo that they cannot knowe it, and the family of <hi>Dauid</hi> deſtroyed by ſundry Emperours: or at the leaſt, ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded that they cannot be diſtinguiſhed: and <hi>Bethlehem</hi> is deſtroyed, &amp; the Temple in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> alluterly caſten down: therefore the <hi>Meſsias</hi> whilk they looke for, will neuer come. And ſo (if this be true) the Antichriſt whilk ye imagine heir will neuer come, ſince your Antichriſt and their <hi>Meſsias</hi> that they looke for, are both one, as your Kirk ſuppones. And I ſay further, <hi>Sanderus</hi> and the Rhemiſts ſayes,
<note place="margin">In 8. demonſt. Rhemiſt. annot. v<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pon the 2, Theſſa</note> the Antichriſt ſhall come of the tribe of <hi>Dan:</hi> if then he ſhall come of the tribe of <hi>Dan,</hi> (as they ſay) the Iewes will neuer receaue him as their Meſsias, becauſe they know their Meſsias whilk they looke for, ſhall come of the tribe of Iuda. Therefore if <hi>Sande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
                     <pb n="288" facs="tcp:20312:172"/> and the Rhemiſts ſpeake true, the Iewes ſhall neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue the Antichriſt at all. Thirdlye, I lay this ground whilk you cannot deny, that the Iewes <hi>are to be planted in again in the naturall Oliue:</hi> that is, they are to be conuerted to Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>their fall was but for a time,</hi> as the Apoſtle plainly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telles,
<note place="margin">Rom. 11. Rhemiſt annot. v<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pon that chapter</note> and the Rhemiſtes graunts it. Vpon the whilk I aske you, Maiſter <hi>Gilbert,</hi> whether ſhall they receaue the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, before, or after their conuerſion? If you ſay, after: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I ſay, after they haue embraced the true Meſsias &amp; the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, how can it be that they will looke for another Meſsias, and receaue the Antichriſt as their Sauiour. Next, we read of their conuerſion in the Scripture, but nothing of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection of Chriſt after their conuerſion. And thirdly, ſeeing (as your Kirk ſayes) the Antichriſt ſhalbe ſent to them, and they ſhal receaue him, becauſe they receaued not Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus: of force then it cannot be after their conuerſion. For the cauſe, to wit, their hardneſſe of heart, and refuſall of the true Meſsias, being taken away: this puniſhment ſhould not bee ſent vnto them after their embracing of Chriſt: ſo not after their conuerſion. And if you ſay before their conuerſion; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I ſay, either muſt you make the reigne of your Antichriſt lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then three yeare and a halfe, (whilk your Kirk does) &amp; put a greater ſpace betwixt the perdition of him, &amp; the end of the world, then your
<note n="a)" place="margin">Bellarmine puts but 45. daies betwene his perdition and the end of the world. lib. 3. de Rom. Pont. c. 17.</note> Kirk does, and ſo ouerthrow your owne doctrine concerning the Antichriſt, that ye may eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhe your imaginary Antichriſt. Or elſe what likelihoode is there that euer they ſhall be conuerted to Chriſt, whilk is againſt both the Scripture, &amp; your owne doctrine? for ſeing the Iewes are to receiue him as their Meſsias, &amp; ſeing he is to builde their Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, reſtore their ceremonies, &amp; obtain y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie of the whole world, eſpecially by their help (as your doctrine affirmes) ſhall not this driue them further from Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Bella 1. lib. 3. de Rom. Pont. cap. 12.16. &amp;c.</note> and harden their harts more then euer it was before? And ſeing he ſhall raigne but three yeares and a halfe, and they cannot embrace the true Sauiour, as long as he raignes (for they cannot embrace both the Antichriſt, and the true Chriſt together) and ſeeing after his death the day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:20312:172"/> ſhall come immediatly, or at the leaſt 45. dayes after, (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſayes:) how can it be poſsible that they ſhal e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be turned to Chriſt before the end of the worlde, if this your doctrine be true? Therefore they cannot receaue the Antichriſt before their conuerſion, and ſo they ſhall neuer receaue the Antichriſt. So then to conclude this point, as the <hi>Meſsias</hi> whilk the poore blinded Iewes lookes for, will neuer come, the true <hi>Meſsias</hi> being come already, whome they cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified: So the Antichriſt whilk ye imagine will neuer come, for the true Antichriſt (whilk either ye will not ſee, or elſe if ye ſee, ye will not confeſſe him) lurkes within your owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, theſe many yeares, whome ye labour to couer, that he ſhould not be ſeene.</p>
                  <p>But how proue ye that the Iewes will receaue the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt? Becauſe our Sauiour ſayes to the Iewes, <hi>If another ſhal come in his owne name, him ye will receaue.</hi> I graunt indeede our Sauiour ſo ſpeakes. But firſte I ſay, this <hi>other</hi> is not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricted to the Antichriſt only,
<note place="margin">Ioſeph. de bello Iudaico, lib. 2. ca. 12. Pet. Gala. lib. 40. cap. 21. Bellarm lib. 3. de Rom. Pont. c. 12.</note> but to be referred to all falſe Prophets, who ſhall come, not being ſent of God, ſo <hi>Nonus,</hi> ſo <hi>Lyra</hi> expones it: and this was fulfilled long ſince in recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of <hi>Theudas</hi> and <hi>Cozban,</hi> and other deceauers whom they receaued. As for <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> it is true, he expones it of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt. But if <hi>Bellarmine</hi> reiects <hi>Auguſtins</hi> opinion concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the generation of the Antichriſt, that he ſhall come of the tribe of <hi>Dan,</hi> becauſe <hi>it cannot</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>bee prooued by the Scripture:</hi> ſhall it not alſo be lawfull for vs, not to be bound to the expoſition of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> vnleſſe it be certain by the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: ſo giue vs that libertye whilk yee take to your ſelues. Your firſt reaſon then hes no feete: for this place ſpeakes of all falſe Prophets whatſomeuer, whilk the Iewes ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue: and it hes bene accompliſhed ſundry times amongſt them: therfore this yet remaines vnprooued that the Iewes ſhall receaue the Antichriſt. This for the firſt part of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. The ſecond part of your argument is, <hi>The Pope came neuer in his owne name, but in the name of Chriſt:</hi> therefore hee is not the Antichriſt. Your antecedent I deny. For if ye will credite <hi>Franciſcus Toledo</hi> if ye knowe him, writing vppon the
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:20312:173"/> ſame place, he ſayes, <hi>He ſhall come in his owne name, who truely ſhall haue no diuine vertue,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Pope come not in the name of Chriſt in truth but in his owne name, becauſe Chriſt left him neuer in his ſtead or left na ſik cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in his worde.</note> 
                     <hi>but ſhall faine himſelf to be ſent of God, as the falſe Prophets came in their owne name, becauſe they were not tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſent of God. And this is that,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>whilk is ſaid now</hi> (meaning in this place) <hi>if only ſhall come in his owne name: that he, is not tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſent of God, neither hes Gods power.</hi> So then a falſe Prophete is ſaide both to come in the name of God, and in his owne name: in the name of God falſlye vanting ſo: in his owne name, becauſe God ſends him not, but he intrudes himſelfe without a lawfull calling. Nowe to anſwere you then, I ſay the Pope comes in the name of Chriſt, as his Vicare, I grant he and his Cleargie ſo vaunts: but falſly. For the truth is, he hes come, and he commes in his owne name, and that truly, becauſe the Lord neuer ſent him, but he hes intruded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe without God his calling: therefore this can not free him but he may be the Antichriſt. But howe proue ye that hee commes in Chriſt his name, and not in his owne name?

So if this argument of yours will follow, The Pope is called the Vicare of Chriſt, &amp; the ſeruand of the ſeruands of God, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee came neuer in his owne name, and ſo hee is not the Antichriſt: you may with as good reaſon conclude, that the falſe Prophetes and falſe Apoſtles, came not in their owne name, but in the name of God, becauſe they are called the ſeruands of God, both by themſelues, and alſo by theſe who were deceaued by them. Yea, you may with as good reaſon conclude, that the Antichriſt is not the ſonne of perdition, &amp; aduerſary to God, and that all the kingdomes of the worlde are giuen to the Diuell, &amp; that he hes the power in his hand of giuing them to whom he will: becauſe the Scripture fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolde of the one, that he ſhould haue hornes like the Lambe,
<note place="margin">2. Theſſal, 2. &amp; Reuel. 17 Matth 4.</note> and the other aſcriues this right and power to himſelfe. It is good therefore that you cannot defend your Pope from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Antichriſt, vnleſſe with him alſo you defend all the falſe Prophets, falſe Apoſtles, falſe Kirks, the Antichriſt, and the Diuell himſelfe, from being the thing whilk they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede.

Dare you avowe this in the preſence of him, who ſhall iudge the quick and the dead, that he is ſo, as he calles himſelfe?

You ſay he is the Vicare of Chriſt, but Chriſt Ieſus in his latter Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, did neuer leaue him to be in his ſtead. For in the 4. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 11. <hi>He gaue Apoſtles, Prophets, Euangeliſts, Paſtors, &amp; Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors for the woorke of the miniſterye, and the building of the bodye of Chriſt.</hi> But that he euer left a Pope to be head of the Kirk in his ſtead, to be a Monarch in this earth, to raigne in Rome, and to be Lorde ouer the ſeruands of God, there is not a ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labe in the whole book of God to proue it. And becauſe you ſay he is the ſeruand or ſeruands: what ſeruice, I pray you, does he wherby he makes it manifeſt that he is a ſeruand in deede? For the principall ſeruice of the miniſtry of the Kirk ſtands in preaching the word, whilk he neither does, neither thinks that it appertaines to him to doe. Yea, what is it that appertaines to ony Lord, King, or Monarch in the earth, that he aſcriues not to himſelfe, and does not alſo practiſe? Yea, as though that were too little, what either ſtile or properties or workes, whilk are peculiar only to God his Maieſty, that he aſcriues not to himſelfe, as (God willing) ſhalbe prooued afterward in the third mark of the Antichriſt. So that <hi>Auen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus</hi> ſaies of the Pope,
<note place="margin">Lib. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>He who is the ſeruand of ſeruands is the lord of Lords, and he deſires to be as though he were God: hee ſpeakes great things as if he were God: he changeth the lawes, eſtabliſheth his owne:
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:20312:174"/> he reaues, he ſpoiles, he deceaues, he ſlayes: that man of perdition, whom men vſes to call Antichriſt,</hi> (ſpeaking of the Pope) <hi>in whoſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bead the name of blaſphemy is written: I am God I cannot erre.</hi> So what is this elſe, but a horrible mocking both of God &amp; man to ſtile him the ſeruand of ſeruands, ſeeing hee hes lifted vp himſelfe, ſo far aboue both God and man? So then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this, as <hi>Goliah</hi> his owne ſworde ſlew himſelf, ſo the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whilk ye bring to defend your Pope from being the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, doth moſt euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly conuict him to be the Antichriſt. He may iuſtly be called the Antichriſt, who vnder pretence of the Vicare of Chriſt, and the ſeruand of ſeruands, is Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch and lord ouer all: this you cannot deny. Becauſe the Scripture deſcriues the Antichriſt to haue two hornes lyke the Lambe, to ſit in the Temple of God,
<note place="margin">Apoc. 13. &amp; 17. 2. Theſſal. 2.</note> to haue a golden Cupe: and yet to ſpeake like the Dragon, to be aduerſary to God, and to lift himſelfe aboue all that is called God. But ſo hes the Popes of Rome done, as it hes, and ſhalbe proued by their owne doctrine and practiſe, and whilk you cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: Therefore he is in very deed that Antichriſt whilk was to come.

                     <p>Your ſecond reaſon is, the Antichriſt is but one ſingular perſon. The Popes hes bene many: therefore they are not the Antichriſt. I deny your propoſition, for there lyes all the
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:20312:175"/> controuerſie. We ſay the Antichriſt is not this Pope, or that Pope an certaine perſon. But wee aſcriue this name, to the whole ſeate and the ſucceſsion of your Popes: we ſay the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and the kingdome of your Romaine Kirk, whereof your Popes are the heades, is that Antichriſt whilk was to come. So if you proue that the Antichriſt ſhould be but a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſon, and not a body, a kingdome, a ſeate and ſucceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of men that are aduerſaries to God and to Ieſus Chriſt, I will graunt you haue ſufficientlie cleared your Pope from beeing Antichriſt. But content your ſelfe (Maiſter <hi>Gilbert:</hi>) this ye will neuer proue by the Scripture: and therefore ye muſt let your Popes be accounted the Antichriſt ſtill. And if this reaſon of yours be good, the Antichriſt is one certaine perſon. Therefore the Popes, becauſe they are many, are not the Antichriſt; wherefore (I pray you) ſhall not this alſo be good: the Vicare of Chriſt is one certaine man, but the Popes are many: therefore they are not Chriſt his Vicare? What difference (I pray you) is there beetwene the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? And if ye will ſay, the Vicare of Chriſt is not one ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar man, but a ſucceſſion of many in one office: why will ye not alſo graunt, that the Antichriſt is not a ſingular man, but the ſucceſsion of many in the ſelfe ſame impietie. So either chooſe you, whether will ye graunt that the Antichriſt is not one ſingular man, but a ſucceſsion of many; or elſe that the Popes are not Chriſt his Vicare: for the one ye muſt doe, if this reaſon of yours holde forth. But how doe ye proue that the Antichriſt is but one ſingular perſon? You ſay, that Saint <hi>Paule</hi> telles that he ſhalbe but one. Howe woulde yee haue cried out, if I had fathered ſik a falſet vpon the ſpirit of God as you do heir? but let ſik be far from mee. You ſay, Saint <hi>Paule</hi> calles him the ſonne of perdition, and puts him in the ſingular nomber: therefore ſay ye, the Antichriſt ſhalbe but one ſingular perſon.

So what warrand haue ye to gather that heir, whilk you dare not gather out of the like phraſes of the Scripture? If then in theſe places there is not a ſingular man vnderſtood, ſuppoſe they ſpeake of a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the ſingular nomber; it will not follow that the Antichriſt muſt be one ſingular perſon, becauſe the Apoſtle ſpeakes of him as of one man, in the ſingular nomber, for the phraſes are all one: but the firſt ye muſt graunt: therefore the next will followe. Secondly, in the 16. of <hi>Matthew,</hi> our Sauiour ſaies, <hi>Epi taute te paetra,</hi> Vpon this rock I will builde my Kirk, he ſpeakes heir in the ſingular nomber with the ſame article <hi>te,</hi> that the Apoſtle ſpeakes of, in deſcriuing the Antichriſt. Nowe let mee vſe this ſame argument againſt your Popes, that they are not this rock vppon the whilk the Kirk is buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as you ſay, as you haue vſed heir to proue that he is not the Antichriſt. This rock vpon the whilk Chriſt promiſed to builde his Kirk, is but one ſingular perſon, becauſe our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our puts him in the ſingular nomber <hi>(Epi taute te petra)</hi> Vpon this rocke: but your Popes of Rome are not one ſingulare perſon, but many: Therefore your Popes of Rome are not this Rock vpon the whilk Chriſt promiſed to builde his Kirk What difference is there betweene your argument for the Pope, and this argument againſt the Pope, ſeeing both are grounded vpon the like phraſe? Chooſe you then, Maiſter <hi>Gilbert,</hi> whether will you haue the Antichriſt, not to be one ſingular perſon, but a ſucceſsion of many: or will you haue the Popes not to be the rockes where upon the Kirk is buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded? for the one ye muſt.

And as for the third thing, the inuocation of Saints departed, I ſay, this argument is ſo far from clearing him from being an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſary to God, that if there were no more, it is ynough to conuict your Popes and your Kirk, that they are aduerſaries to God. For he is an aduerſary to God, who robbes God of any portion of his glory,

For wee
<note n="a)" place="margin">Rom. 10.14.</note> ought to call vpon them onlie, in whome only we ought to beleeue. But we ought only to
<note n="b)" place="margin">Ierem. 17.5</note> beleeue in God: therfore we ſhould only pray to him through Ieſus Chriſt. And hee only ſhould be incalled vpon, who knowes our neceſsities, &amp; is able to heare our praiers, and to graunt them. But only God in Chriſt, the ſearcher of the heart doth theſe thinges: Therefore he only ought to be incalled vpon. Heir therefore ye giue out a ſufficient euidence againſt your Popes &amp; your Kirk, that you are Antichriſtian, and aduerſaries vnto God: For that whilk ye bring heir to clenſe him, does fyle him.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The Pope may be an idolater, &amp; yet a hypocrite, he may ſpeake like the Dragon, &amp; yet be like the Lambe, he may confeſſe him in word, and deny him in deeds, he may be a raue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous wolfe, and yet clothed in a ſheepes clothing</note> Indeede, I will neither deny the hypocriſie nor idolatry of your Popes, for they both aggree vnto them: and that whilk <hi>Origen</hi> ſayes of the Antichriſt, is true of them: for they holde nothing of Chriſt, but his name: they neither doe his

And yet for all their hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie and pretence of godlineſſe and humility, theſe notes and markes of the Antichriſt, as the worde of God hes deſcriued him, doth euery way aggree to them. So that if the word of God be true in ſetting downe the markes of the Antichriſt, your Popes who beares theſe markes, of neceſsity muſt bee the ſame.

It would appeare that you thinke, that the reading of that worke woulde haue altered my minde ſomewhat concerning your Popes, that they are not the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt: and it appeares to me, by that your earneſt deſire, that the doctrine ſet downe in that treatiſe is worthy of all credite and authority, and that your ſelf is of that ſelfe ſame iudgement concerning the Antichriſt with the author of that treatiſe: for I thinke you would not haue wiſhed mee to read that thing, whilk ye your ſelfe beleeues not to bee true. I therefore reade it, and reade it ouer againe. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide many other thinges, I finde this in it: that the Antichriſt ſhould be borne of a Virgine, by the helpe of the Diuell, as Chriſt was borne of the Virgine by the worke of the holye Ghoſt. I wondered that you ſhould haue wiſhed me to read that booke, in the whilk there was ſo manifeſt an error, and that contrary the doctrine of your own Kirk. You ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of this (M. <hi>Gilbert:</hi>) for if your head and Kirk get wit of it, they will not only count you a bad defender of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Faith, as you ſay you are: but alſo it may be they ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect you of hereſie, who does wiſhe your aduerſaries to read that booke, wherein ſo manifeſt an error is, and that againſt the doctrine of your owne Kirk.

                        <hi>Bellarmine</hi> that great defender of your Catholick faith, was more wiſe then you in this point.

And let your Pope who is the bond of vnity amongſt you, ſee to this: howe to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile you and <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> two defenders of his Catholick faith; you ſaying that that worke is <hi>Auguſtines,</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denying it, and affirming that it cannot be his: you wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your aduerſaries to read it, and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confuting a manifeſt errour in it.

And firſt, I will lay this ground whilk (Maiſter <hi>Gilbert</hi>) cannot gaineſay, and the conſcience of all men will ſubſcriue to. That as the true Chriſt is ſufficientlye deſcriued in the olde and new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo the Antichriſt is ſufficiently deſcriued there alſo: and as he is to be beleeued, vnder the paine of the endleſſe damnation of their ſoules to bee the true Chriſt, to whome the prophecies of the olde Teſtament concerning the Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to come, doth aggre; and of whome the new Teſtament teſtifieth that they are accompliſhed: So hee muſt bee that Antichriſt whilk the Scripture fore-tolde was to come, to whome euerie one of the markes and properties of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt ſet downe in the ſame, doth aggree, and in whome they are found to be accompliſhed. Let vs therefore out of the Scripture ſearche the markes of the Antichriſt, and then let vs ſee whether their Popes of Rome bee ſtamped with theſe markes or not. I ſpeake not nowe of the many Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts wherof <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeakes,
<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 2.18.</note> whilk were fore-runners of that
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:20312:179"/> great defection, whilk was fore-tolde ſhoulde come in the Kirk of God: but of that chiefe and great Antichriſt, who not in one or two things only, but almoſt in all the points of his Religion, ſhould be contrary to Ieſus Chriſt,
<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 4.3.2. Theſ. 2, Apoc 11 13.17.18.</note> whome the places of Scripture noted on the margent, does deſcriue. And while as I affirme, that the Popes of Rome are this great Antichriſt, I vnderſtand it thus: that they are the Prince &amp; head of that defection and apoſtaſie, whilk the Scripture fore-ſhewe and fore-told was to come in the Kirk. For I doe not thinke, that all the ſtrength and force of the Antichriſt, is included in the Pope: but the Pope &amp; his kingdome whilk is contrary to the kingdome of Chriſt, is moſte truely called the Antichriſt: whereof, becauſe the Pope is the Prince and head: therefore by that figure, taking the part for the whole, I call him the Antichriſt. And in this we followe the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: for the Scripture ſpeaking of the Antichriſt, ſometime calles it a defection, and a myſtery of iniquity, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond beaſt that hes the hornes like the Lambe, and the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lote: and ſometimes points out the principall and chiefe in this kingdome, on whome the whole body of iniquity doeth hang: as when he writes heir, the man of ſinne, and ſonne of perdition, whilk is an aduerſary, who extolles himſelf aboue all &amp;c. whilk is moſt properly ſpoken, not of the bodie, but of the head. Hauing ſhowne now in what ſenſe we take the Antichriſt, we will goe to the matter. And firſte to that 2. <hi>Theſſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

But the doctrine of the Kirk of Rome ranuerſes this doctrine of our ſaluation, and teaches that Chriſt ſuffered not the wrath of God vpon his ſoule: whilk if it be true, then Chriſt hes not paied our debt ſufficiently: for our debt was not onely the naturall death of the bodie, but the wrath of God vpon the ſoule:
<note place="margin">Ezech. 18.20.</note> and therefore the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſayes, <hi>the ſoule that ſinnes ſhall die the death.</hi> Secondly, the Scripture teſtifies,

Yea, what is this elſe, but to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues God? for who can ſatisfie the iuſtice of God, but God himſelfe? Thirdly, as it hes bene prooued before, Chriſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered vp himſelfe once, by ſhedding of his blood vppon the Croce, neuer to be offered vp againe, whilk hes purchaſed a euerlaſting redemption: the whilk is the onely ground of mans ſaluation.

<note place="margin">Rom. 4.22.23.24 3.5.6.7.</note> but they place it in our owne workes and in our owne merites.

And ſo they ſpoyle man of righteouſnes and ſaluation.</p>
                     <p>And as they haue ſpoyled Chriſt, of the firſte parte of his office of his prieſt-hoode, ſo doe they ſpoyle him of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde parte thereof, vvhilk conſiſts in his interceſsion: in ioyning vvith him innumerable interceſſors and mediators, aſvvell of Angels as of Saintes departed, at vvhoſe handes they ſeeke all maner of grace, vvhilk is onlie proper to Ieſus Chriſt to giue: &amp; that not only for the vertue of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> merites of Chriſt, but for their own merites &amp; interceſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

                     <p>And as their doctrine hes robbed the Lorde Ieſus of his prieſtly dignitie, and man of the benefite of eternall life pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed to him by the ſame: So haue they robbed him of that

For I ſhal not ſpeake heir begeſſe, for that were greate fooliſhnes to alledge heir anye other thing, nor that whilk is written in their owne bookes, ſeing he hes promiſed to giue an anſwere leaſt he ſhuld challenge me of lying of them.

                     <p>Nowe as they haue ſpoyled him of his Prieſtly office, ſo haue they robbed him of his Kingly office.

As for the firſt. Hee by his Spirit prepares the harte by bringing vs to a ſight and ſenſe of our miſerie, that vvee may runne to him to ſeeke for mercie: And then hee by his Spirit vvorkes that liuing faith, whilk makes vs fullie aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of ſaluation, whilk workes by loue, and brings foorth the fruites of holines and righteouſneſſe, vvhereof prayer is one ſpeciall. All whilk is taken away by their doctrine. As to the firſt: No ſufficient knowledge of their miſerie among them. For firſt their doctrine is, that <hi>we are not dead in ſinne, but man hes free-wil: and then that concupiſence after Baptiſme is not ſinne, &amp; that the adoring and worſhipping of Images, is not the breaking of the ſecond command: And that the rewarde of euerie ſinne is not euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting death.

This for the 4. marke.</p>
                     <p>The fifth marke of the Antichriſt, as he is deſcriued by the Apoſtle is in theſe words:

                        <hi>Ye know</hi> (ſayes the Apoſtle) <hi>what withholdeth:</hi> namely, that he might be reuealed in his owne time.

So then it behooued the empire to tranſlate his ſeat from Rome, that Rome whilk was firſt the ſeat of the empire, might be the ſeate of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt. Now the iſſue and euent, is a ſure and cleere inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of this Prophecie: For <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Emperour of Rome, tranſlated his ſeate from Rome, to <hi>Byzantium</hi> called <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in Greece. And peece and peece that empire of the Greeke Emperour began to decay. And was tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Greekes to the French-men by the Popes: and then from them to the Germanes, by the Popes alſo. So that both Rome and a great part of Italie, and at the laſt a great

So that nowe he vaunts himſelfe to be Monarch of the whole worlde, and all Kings and Princes gaue him their oath of allengeance: &amp; the Emperours and Kings held their empires and kingdoms of him, and are but his vaſſals. (as their Canon Lawe ſaies) So that by the taking away of the Roman empire, the Popes did then climbe vp to their ſupremacie, &amp; make themſelues manifeſt, that they were the Antichriſt. And ſo this doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo aggree to the Pope of Rome, and to none other. He is the Antichriſt, whoſe climbing vp was letted by the Romane empire, and who is builded vp vpon the ruines of the ſame: But the Papacie is ſik: therefore the Papacie is that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian kingdome.</p>

For as in the Romane impire, there was an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour whome all did worſhip as God: vnto whome there was ioyned a Senate, who was next in authority to him: ſo is the frame of the gouernement of the Papiſtical kingdome There is a Monarch the Pope; whome all are compelled, when they come in his ſight, to worſhip as an earthly God, to whoſe ſentence al muſt ſtand to, who iudgeth all, but can be iudged of none, who hes ioined with him a Senate of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, who are next him in authority.

                        <hi>He may create new Religions:</hi> thirdly, to be tribunes; that is to diſanull what ſomeuer decree or iudgement, of anye Biſhop or inferiour iudges: yea of ſynodall and generall councels, if they be not ratified by him. Thirdly, as in Rome was the heade of the empire, the Emperour and his Senate with him, and as the Emperours had their Magiſtrates vnder them, in all their prouinces, and places of their dominions, from whome all their authoritie was, and who was at their beck and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement: So in the Popes Kingdome, the Pope who is the head, and the Senate of Cardinals whilk is next him in authoritie, hes their ſeate in Rome: and they according to

The blood of infinite thouſands does teſtifie this. And wha hes brought all vnder their bondage, both one &amp; other, that none might buy or ſel: that is, neither brooke Ciuill nor Eccleſiaſticall offices, but thoſe who were marked with his marke: that is, tooke on them his profeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and was Catholickes (as he tearmes them,) Is not this ſufficiently knowne, that none might haue offices nor bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices in the Kirk, but they that receaued his marke, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours from him?
